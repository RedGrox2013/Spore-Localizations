You'll have to search for them.
0x00000005 On planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, people say that there's nothing finer than a ~mission_multi_delivery_item~. Is it true? Maybe it is, and maybe it's not, but I don't care as long as that's what they want!~p~I'm sure there are some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics in our star system.

0x00000007 Nature, ~player_creature_name~. It's all around us. It's inside of everything, and everything is a part of nature. Even inanimate things like ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. They are still our brothers in nature, and I can hear them talking to us. No I'm not crazy, I can really hear them. They want us to find them and take them to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~.~p~Can you give them a lift?
0x00000008 The inhabitants of planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ are freaking out. They're looking for ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics, but can't find any.

Bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ to chill everybody out.
0x00000009 Someone from planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ told us that ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics hold clues to the great secrets of nature and the Universe. There are some in our star system... but we haven't figured it out. This secret must be really deep, you know. Heavy stuff.~p~Find some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics and bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~... Maybe they can work out what it all means.
0x0000000A Spode's own sacred appendages created a series of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. These were lost in the tumultuous War of Spodification.~p~Through Spode's holy guidance, we have detected some of the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics close by. Will you find them and bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, that the inhabitants might bow down before them?

Thanks be to Spode, we have discovered their existence. Will you search for these items and bring them to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ so that they may be destroyed?
0x0000000C Long ago, far in the history of our species, ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts were treated as holy relics. We must find out if this is still compatible with the Word of Spode!~p~The ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics should be acquired from within our star system and brought to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ for further study.
0x0000000D A series of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts were created to commemorate the anniversary of our federation. Some of these were stolen during pirate raids. It has recently come to the Grand Council's attention that these missing artifacts are being stored on other planets.~p~Please retrieve them and deliver them to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ for the Festival of Federation.
0x0000000E An ancient text, the creation of a vanished race, has recently been discovered. It refers to several ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts stored on nearby planets.

Can you find them and complete the delivery?
0x00000011 We have decoded a document from an vanished alien species that informs us of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics scattered on different worlds. Analysis of these items would not only tell us about this ancient species, but might shed light on current mysteries as well. The best facilities for this analysis are located on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~.~p~Would you be willing to acquire these items and bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~?
0x00000012 In the Centennial Year of the Rule of Reason, an accident resulted in the scattering of many ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics across nearby planets.

The remaining ones are all in this star system.
0x00000014 Once upon a time, ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts were all the rage in our civilization! Then they fell out of favor, and people hid them far away out of embarrassment.

But then again, who am I to judge?~p~Do you think you can find some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts and deliver them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~?
0x00000015 Would you like to go on a wild ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifact chase?

0x00000002 Do you detect something in the air? Of course you do, because I do, and we both know you're every bit as clever as I am! There's profit to be made, I can smell it! And I'll bet Sporebucks to space dust that it has to do with the planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~.~p~You see, over on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, there's a strong demand for rare items. Specifically, demand for ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. And guess what we just happen to have here in this star system?~p~Let's make a deal.

0x00000016 Someone on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ is a serious collector of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. And when someone's serious, there's always serious Sporebucks to be made!~p~I know for a fact that we have some of these relics in this very star system. Why don't we make a deal here? It'll be a standard search-and-deliver contract: you go out and find these things, you bring them to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, you come back here for payment.
0x00000017 When you have a reputation like we do, and boy do we have a reputation, sometimes fortune just drops into your lap. We just heard through the spacevine that there's a demand for ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. And does a smart ~player_creature_name~ like you know how rare those things are? That's right! They're not rare at all around here!~p~We've got our hands full with committed deals already, so why don't you handle this one for us? Fly around and collect some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. Bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, and head back here for your cut of the profits.
0x00000018 Hey, how do you feel about ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics? Like them? Hate them? Don't know what they are?

0x0000001A We require ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics for the annual Ceremony of Actualization! The ceremony takes place on ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. Can you help us find some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics and deliver them to the Actualization Academy for the ceremony?
0x0000001B I've heard it said that 'Those Who Went Before have placed the Items That Went Ahead on Worlds That Are Not Yet Gone'. I'm pretty sure that the items are actually ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts within our star system. Can you find these items, and take them to the Teachers Who Are Still Loitering Around on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~?
0x00000004 People of planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ want special things. They pay for ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. There are ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics here in this star system. Someone must find them and deliver them. ~player_creature_name~ can do this.
0x0000001C Long ago, we left ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics on other planets. Now pirates go to steal them. ~player_creature_name~ will collect these things and bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, safe from pirates. We will pay ~player_creature_name~ for doing this.
0x0000001D Some planets nearby have ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. Once, we left these to mark places where we lost battles. They shame us. We have learned from our shame. Now they are useless! Find these things and take them away. Some say that planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ wants them. Take them there.

0x0000001F How am I going to find these items?
0x00000020 Where exactly should I start looking?
0x00000021 Isn't this like looking for needles in a haystack?
0x00000022 How can I search an entire star system?
0x00000023 Sorry, but I am not your errand-being today.
0x00000024 I would rather not do this.
0x00000025 This really isn't my kind of thing.
0x00000026 Now is not a good time for this.

0x00000035 Okay. I can help you with this.
0x00000036 Sounds like fun, I'll do it.
0x00000037 You got it. Let's get started.
0x00000038 Okay. Let's do this thing!
0x00000039 This mission is not for me.
0x0000003A I'm not interested in doing this.
0x0000003B You should find someone else for this job.
0x0000003C No, I can't help you with this.
0x00000043 You're totally making the Universe a better place... Thank you.
0x00000044 Let Spode's will be done! You may begin at once!
0x00000045 The Grand Council of the Federation thanks you. Please hurry.
0x00000046 Excellent. Your assistance is strengthening our hypothesis on ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~ behavior.
0x00000047 How fantastic! I'd sing you a song, if only it wouldn't delay your start!
0x00000048 Wonderful! I knew we had the right ~player_creature_name~ for the job.
0x00000049 We thank you for your assistance!
0x0000004A Good. We ~race~ are pleased by your assistance.
0x0000016D ACKNOWLEDGED. COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY.
0x0000016E Great! We know you'll do a fine job!
0x00000073 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000074 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000075 Also...
0x00000076 One more thing...
0x00000077 I should be off. Farewell!
0x00000078 Thank you for the opportunity. I'm heading out now.
0x00000079 I will return shortly. So long for now.
0x0000007A It's time to start. I'll see you when I return.
0x0000004F That's unfortunate. We would have liked to work with you on this. Perhaps some other time.
0x00000050 Of course, of course. I knew it was hopeless to bring such a trivial matter to so glorious a one as yourself. Perhaps you could console me by spending money in the boutique?
0x00000051 Oooh... okay. Yes, that's okay.~p~If your heart is not in it, we wouldn't want you interacting with another life form.
0x00000052 No? ~player_creature_name~ is weaker than expected. Next time, maybe we should not offer reward. We do not pay weaklings.
0x00000054 But... but... but... but... but... but... but... but... ~p~Okay.
0x00000055 MISSION DECLINED. REASON: ~player_creature_name~ is an inferior species.
0x00000057 The Way of Spode is apparently not for ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You may leave us.
0x00000058 Very well. Please do not let us detain you from your many more important tasks.
0x00000059 Interesting choice ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Perhaps you have some information we do not, although that seems unlikely.
0x0000005C You must follow your own path.~p~Be well my friend.
0x0000005E Wait. One more thing.
0x0000005F I just had one more thing to ask...
0x00000060 I have one more question.
0x00000061 Can I ask you something?
0x00000062 Okay. I'm off.
0x00000063 Well, bye.
0x00000064 Sorry that I couldn't help. Good-bye.
0x00000065 I beg your understanding.
0x00000066 Perfectly understandable, Captain.~p~Sorry to trouble you with such matters.
0x00000067 This is a gross breach of contract! If we were a lesser race, we'd perhaps sue you for every Sporebuck you're worth!~p~It is a good thing for you that we are such a kind, understanding species... with very good prices.~p~Have you seen by our shop of galatic wares?
0x00000068 You're giving up? But we were counting on you! That's harsh... Giving up when people are counting on you is... seriously uncool. Try not to disappoint people in the future.
0x00000069 ~player_creature_name~ made a promise! ~player_creature_name~ accepted the mission! Only weakest, most spineless worms go back on their word. Today ~player_creature_name~ is worms.
0x0000006A But... but... but... but... but... but... but... but...~p~Okay.
0x0000006B MISSION FAILURE. REASON: Aborted by ~player_creature_name~.~p~STATEMENT OF EXTREME DISPLEASURE
0x0000006D You have gone back on your promise, given under the eyes and ears of Spode, to help us. Our ecclesiastical courts shall consider the implications on your soul.
0x0000006E Your lack of reliability will be duly noted throughout our federation.
0x0000006F Is your species even capable of success? You are causing us to doubt our own theories about the ~player_creature_name~.
0x00000072 The Oneness must have a place for you in the Great Plan. We lesser beings have no idea what the place might be for a failure such as yourself.
0x0000009F I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000A0 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000A1 Also...
0x000000A2 One more thing...
0x000000A3 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000A4 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000A5 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000A6 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x0000004C I beg your understanding. 
0x0000004D Excellent work, Captain! I knew we could count on you.~p~Here's your reward, as promised: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. Enjoy!
0x0000004E Welcome, welcome, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~! Another successful job! Not surprising, not surprised, given who I'm dealing with.~p~Here's the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks as stipulated in our contract.~p~I don't often take pleasure in business, but it's always a pleasure dealing with someone as talented as yourself.
0x000000C9 Oh my... it's already done? Wonderful! It's been great to work with someone so... in tune with the Universe.~p~Here's ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks; spend it wisely, okay?
0x0000007B Good! ~player_creature_name~ do good work. Here is ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks as promised.
0x0000007C Oh, a job done well, a job done right! We'll sing a song for you tonight... a song of joy and glee and cheer, for all the help you've given here!~p~Here's what we promised: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000007D MISSION STATUS: Complete~p~STATEMENT OF ENCOURAGEMENT: Exemplary work. Other biological species should be so capable.~p~COMPENSATION DELIVERY: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000007F Well met, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Word of your success was written. We were right to place Faith in you... as we are always right.~p~Your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks are well deserved. Please take a sacred text with you as you go.
0x00000080 Welcome ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. The Grand Council has been informed of your successful delivery and thanks you.~p~I am authorized to award a Certificate of Commendation, Second Class, as well as ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000081 Welcome, returning ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Your perspicacity in the matter of returning our ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts has been a pleasant discovery.~p~By all means, take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x00000084 Kind traveler. Thank you for your assistance, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~Our teachers tell us that we're all going to be Secret Masters in future incarnations. Perhaps some day you will be one, too. But while you are still attached to material goods, we happily offer your payment of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x00000086 Just one more thing...
0x00000087 One last thing...
0x00000088 May I ask a question?
0x00000089 Before I go...
0x00000013 Thank you. Farewell.
0x0000008E Hey, you didn't finish the job! Pay attention to your Mission Log.~p~Find the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts on these planets:~p~~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~.~p~When you have them, bring them all to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. Return here after you've done those things.
0x0000008F What now? Do you need to be reminded of the terms of this contract again? You're supposed to collect ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts from the following planets: ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~.~p~Once you have them, head over to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ and deliver the items. Then, once you've done all that, your end of the contract will be fulfilled. You have records of this in your Mission Log.
0x00000090 Did you forget what to do? Maybe it... slipped your mind? It's okay, it happens to the best of us. Next time try your personal Mission Log first.~p~Gather all the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics from ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~ and deliver them to the planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~.
0x00000091 ~player_creature_name~ has not finished the task! Go to these planets and find the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics: ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~.~p~Then go to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. Only come back here for Sporebucks after delivery.
0x00000092 Oh, now! Surely you must realize that you're not done! Do pay attention!~p~Gather up the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics located here: ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~.~p~After gathering the items, report to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. Then finally, return here. Only after delivering the items shall you receive compensation for your journey.
0x00000093 MISSION STATUS: Incomplete~p~REMINDER: Retrieve ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts from: ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~. Deliver to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~.~p~NOTE: See personal Mission Log for details.
0x00000095 The ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics have not all been recovered! They're still out there! Is the information not available in your Mission Log?~p~Remember to search these planets: ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~. Then bring the items to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. Perhaps now you will continue in your sacred task.
0x00000096 We are informed that you have yet to retrieve all the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts and deliver them to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. The information you need to continue should available be available in your Mission Log.~p~In case you have forgotten, the items can be found on these planets: ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~. Return here only once the delivery is complete.
0x00000097 We are disappointed that the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts have not all been recovered from ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~. If you failed to locate the parameters in your Mission Log, we are not surprised. 
0x0000009A Haven't you found all the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics yet? We were counting on you to fetch them! We even gave you a list of planets to search: ~mission_multi_delivery_item_planet_list~. Bring the items to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ once you've collected them all, and return here only when that's done.~p~This should all in your Mission Log.
0x0000009C Okay. Just one more thing...
0x0000009D I see. But I have another question...
0x0000009E Right. Lemme ask you something else...
0x000000E8 I have just one more thing to ask...
0x000000E9 Needles in a haystack! I quit!
0x000000EA I don't like the odds. I quit.
0x000000EB Ehhh. Forget it, I'm busy after all.
0x000000EC Whatever. I'm done with this.
0x000000ED Okay. I've got it now.
0x000000F5 Ohhh. Okay. I'm cool now.
0x000000F6 I see what I was doing wrong. Thanks.
0x000000A7 What? Okay. I see. Got it.
0x000000A8 ...
0x000000A9 What? Who? Where? What's going on?
0x000000AA Huh? Can I get a refresher?
0x000000AB Yeah. I forgot my mission.
0x000000AC Can you remind me of my mission?
0x0000001E I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000002D I shall return later. Farewell.
0x000000AD ...
0x000000AE I have a delivery of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts for you from the ~mission_source_empire~.
0x00000031 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000032 I shall return later. Farewell.
0x000000B4 ...
0x000000B5 The ~mission_source_empire~ asked that I bring you some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.
0x000000B6 The ~mission_source_empire~ sent me... I'm supposed to bring you something I think...
0x00000034 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000003D I shall return later. Farewell.
0x000000BB Welcome, Captain!~p~We heard that you were coming with ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. Do you have them?
0x0000003E Welcome ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~We were told that you were bringing ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts to our planet. Is that correct?
0x0000003F Welcome ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~Our scan of your ship shows that you are carrying some number of the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. Our analysis is correct?
0x00000040 Welcome, welcome ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~We were told that you were bringing ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts to our planet. Is that correct?
0x000000BD Hey there, buddy. We heard that you were bringing us a whole shipment of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. Like, at least ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ of them. That's far out, man. Do you have them with you?
0x00000041 Welcome ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~We were told that you were bringing ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics to our planet.~p~We are ready to receive you and your cargo.
0x000000BE ~player_creature_name~ bring ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics, yes?
0x00000042 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, we have Faith thou hast delivered unto us the ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics!~p~Verily, is this so?
0x000000BF The heavens doth part, and lo, fate's arrow, borne on wings of...~p~Oh, I can't keep that up anyway. Not when you've brought ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics! You did bring them, right?
0x000000BC EXPECTED DELIVERY: ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.~p~EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL: Yesterday.~p~DELIVERY HAS ARRIVED? YES/NO
0x000000C5 Yes, I've come with a delivery.
0x00000177 Small galaxy, ay Captain. What a coincidence that YOU were asked to bring us the ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.~p~I suppose Sporebucks is Sporebucks. We'll see you again when you locate the items.
0x0000004B Oh yes. I am remembering something about this in the last transmission of paperwork for the Main Distribution Center. We were expecting someone with ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. You don't have any. Not to point any fingers, but the problem is not on our side, you know?
0x000000CA You can read a contract, right? Look, we specifically agreed on a delivery of ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. Nothing more, nothing less. If you don't have ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics, you had better come back with them.
0x00000053 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. I see you have decided it would be most efficient to verify your delivery location before indentifying the objects of delivery. Interesting. Perhaps you can explain this logic to use later.~p~In the meantime, we will await the deliver of ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.
0x000000CB DELIVERY FAILURE. REASON: Incompetence of ~player_creature_name~.~p~RECOMMENDATION: Come back with ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.
0x000000CC ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. ~player_creature_name~ did not bring ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. Come back with ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~, or do not come back.
0x00000056 It is written that you, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~ will deliver unto us the number of ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics.~p~So it is written, right here in this contract... so it shall be.
0x000000CD Who did you say you were? ~player_creature_name~? ~player_creature_name~?...No, we have no contract with you. We would remember such a silly spaceship as yours! Ho ho!~p~Now, we do have an agreement with the ~mission_source_empire~... Are you working for them...? ~p~Well! Why didn't you say so?!? Or did you? I can't recall. No matter, no matter.~p~If you are working for the ~mission_source_empire~ you should be collecting ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics for delivery to us...~p~If you are not, you should talk to them... they are very nice people... except on Thursdays.
0x0000005A Who did you say you were? ~player_creature_name~? Hmm... wait... it's coming to me.... ~mission_source_empire~ sent you yes? You were to bring us the ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics... but here you are... without them.~p~That's kinda of weird, right? Seems like you should have them...
0x000000CE We anticipate your arrival with ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics.~p~Shall you collect the relics and then return?~p~We will attend thee.
0x000000CF I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000005B Oops. I'll be right back!
0x000000D3 Thanks, Captain!~p~I see you still have ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ ~^p^mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items^artifact^artifacts~ to deliver.~p~We'll be here when you are ready.
0x0000005D I see you are making a partial delivery.~p~This is not Standard Operating Procedure and is likely to confuse the Department of Receivables... but we are anxious to receive any of the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.~p~I'll keep this one here... return quickly with the remaining ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~.
0x0000006C ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. I see you have decided it would be most efficient to make partial deliveries. Interesting. Perhaps you can explain this logic to use later.~p~In the meantime, we will await the deliver of ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ more.
0x000000D4 You can read a contract, right? Look, we specifically, specifically agreed on a delivery of ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. Nothing more, nothing less. If you don't have ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts, you had better come back with them.
0x00000070 Wow, cool.~p~We are totally happy to receive you delivery... but... it looks like you still need to locate ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ more... ya?~p~Okay, cool. We'll be here... being cool. 
0x000000D5 DELIVERY FAILURE. REASON: Incompetence of ~player_creature_name~.~p~RECOMMENDATION: Come back with ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.
0x00000071 Thank you, gentle traveler.~p~We anticipate the arrival of the remaining ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics.~p~Collect them and return and we will attend thee.
0x000000D6 ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics! ~player_creature_name~ did not bring ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics! Come back with ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~, or do not come back.
0x0000007E Wouldst thou tease the mighty ~race~ with a fewer number of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics than what was called for?~p~If we were not such devoted followers of the Philosophy of Faith, we might question your ability to delivery unto us the full amount. But in Faith, we know you shall return with all.
0x000000D7 To speak of ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics, and then show up with fewer... Such reprehensible behavior!!~p~Come back when you have all ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics.
0x000000D9 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000082 I shall return!

0x000000DE Let's see here... yes, yes, you've brought all the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. Good job! Great job!~p~I wouldn't expect a fine, fine ~player_creature_name~ like you to have had any problems, but I have to check, you know? Just between us, you'd be amazed how many species never learn to count correctly.~p~You should return to the ~mission_source_empire~ for your payment.
0x00000085 Greetings and peace, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~The ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics have been received. Thanks be to you.~p~You should return to the ~mission_source_empire~ in the ~mission_source_star~ star system for payment... or feel free to just stay and float for a bit. Floating is nice.
0x000000DF DELIVERY COMPLETE.~p~RECOMMENDATION: Return to ~mission_source_empire~ for compensation.

0x000000E3 Well. Guess I'm done here.
0x000000E4 Guess I should get headed back, then...
0x000000E5 Looks like I'm done here. I'm gonna take off.
