0x00000005 We've discovered life on ~mission_target_planet~ and the world now requires a survey. Can you perform a survey for us?
0x00000001 ~mission_target_planet~ may be suitable for settlement, but before we can be certain, we need a survey. Can you provide one?
0x0000000D Data on ~mission_target_planet~ went missing in a pirate raid. Can you provide a survey? 
0x0000000E Great news! Your scans show that ~mission_target_planet~ has a supply of ~mission_item~! We can make a bundle on this if you only bring it here, so please bring us a supply! 
0x0000000F Your scans show that ~mission_item~ exists on ~mission_target_planet~! We'd like to investigate ~mission_item~ further, so please bring us a supply.
0x00000010 Thanks, Captain! Your scans show ~mission_item~ on ~mission_target_planet~. This is a strategic asset, so we'd like you to bring us a supply.
0x00000002 In accordance with a directive of the Grand Council to discover other worlds for possible settlement, an unmanned probe has discovered life on ~mission_target_planet~. You would have the thanks of the Grand Council if you would be willing to evaluate this world for us.
0x00000012 In order to better protect our citizens, the Grand Council has declared a security zone that includes ~mission_target_planet~. It would aid our efforts if we could settle this world, but an adequate survey does not exist. Would you undertake such a survey on our behalf?
0x00000028 The Grand Council encourages increased knowledge of all worlds, cultures, and biomes. Would you be willing to aid in increasing our knowledge? 
0x0000003D Your scans show that the world has a supply of ~mission_item~, which the Grand Council has declared an important strategic substance. Can you return to ~mission_target_planet~ and return with a supply of ~mission_item~?
0x00000003 Our compliments on a successful mission. ~mission_target_planet~ has, thanks to your scans, been shown to possess ~mission_item~. This item is the subject of ongoing research that the Grand Council has deemed 'important, but not critical.' Will you aid the Grand Council and bring a supply of ~mission_item~?
0x00000067 Your scans have proved very useful to the Grand Council in the allocation of available resources. We note that ~mission_item~ has been found on this world. We have an insufficient knowledge of this item, and we hope that you will return to ~mission_target_planet~ and bring us a supply of ~mission_item~.
0x00000004 A delightful new world has been discovered at ~mission_target_star~! In order to determine which of our vast industrial cartels may best plunder its resources, a planetary survey is necessary. Can you bestir your greatness in order to help us, in exchange of course for considerable reward?
0x0000007D Oh, I am a wretched being! The world of ~mission_target_planet~ requires a survey, but I have no surveyors! Instead, all I have is money lying around in heaps! ~p~Perhaps a solution may occur to your vast intelligence?
0x000000A8 Happily we do the Dance of Acquirement! The real estate market at ~mission_target_planet~ is ready to zoom for the stratosphere! All that is required is a survey, so that we can best determine where to place our settlements. ~p~Perhaps your great mind can be put to this matter, if we make it worth your while?
0x00000006 Oh, frabjous day! Your scans show that the planet holds a supply of the highly profitable ~mission_item~! Can you bring some to us? Be sure your reward shall be vast. 
0x000000A9 Your scans show that ~mission_item~ may be found on ~mission_target_planet~! We have a highly profitable use for this item, and great would be the rewards of anyone who could fetch us a supply!
0x000000AA The awesomeness of your scans is matched only by our ability to sniff out a profit! This world is filled with ~mission_item~, which is highly valuable! Only a mighty explorer of your capabilities can possibly fetch us a supply... in return for the usual vast reward, of course.
0x00000007 ~mission_target_planet~ has been placed within our security zone, but the world has not yet had a complete survey. Would you be willing to help us?
0x00000008 Our recon teams are committed to a long-term project elsewhere, just as we need a survey of ~mission_target_planet~. Will you survey the world for us?
0x000000AB ~mission_target_planet~ needs a thorough survey to make certain that our settlers have no unpleasant surprises waiting for them. Would you be willing to make such a survey?

0x000000AF We found a new world at ~mission_target_planet~. We'd like to put up our resorts and beachfront hotels, but if the animals are hostile, or if the plants are poison! Can you shimmer over to ~mission_target_planet~, and scan everything for us?
0x000000B0 We found a secluded little planet that might make a terrific rustic getaway, but for all we know, everything in the environment might kill us! Would it be possible for you to survey ~mission_target_planet~ for us?

0x000000BC In order to fulfill Spode's Grand Design, we need a scan of all life-forms on ~mission_target_planet~. If you were willing to do this for us, we might have more work for you. 
0x000000BD Our theologians desire that all living things be recorded in the Book of Existence, and categorized as clean or unclean. Can you travel to ~mission_target_planet~, and there scan all living things?
0x000000BE Praise Spode! A new world has been discovered teeming with Spode's handiwork! Can you travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and make a survey?
0x000000BF Spode be praised! Your scans show that the planet holds a supply of ~mission_item~. In accordance with the Forty-First Prophecy of Spode, ~mission_item~ must be brought to this, our own world. Will you perform for us this holy task?
0x000000C0 You have located for us ~mission_item~, which some believe to be the 'arthngleb' referred to in Spode's Forty-First Prophecy! A supply must be brought here at once! Will you take this blessing unto yourself?
0x000000C1 Truly the works of Spode are wondrous! Thanks to your scans, we know that ~mission_item~ can be found on ~mission_target_planet~! This item is one of those mentioned in Spode's Forty-First Prophecy! Will you bring us a supply?
0x000000C2 In order to better understand the galactic Life Web and our place in it, we try to collect data from every possible source. Could you travel to ~mission_target_planet~ on our behalf and perform some scans?

0x000000CD Thank you for these highly useful scans. They show that ~mission_item~ is to be found on ~mission_target_planet~. As this item is rare on our own world, we would like to study it. Can you fetch us a supply?
0x00000013 Okay. I'm in.
0x00000014 I'm feeling adventurous. I'll do it!
0x00000015 Yeah. I can do that.
0x00000016 Sure thing.
0x00000017 Now's no good. Sorry.
0x00000018 Ooh. I've got a conflict. My bad.
0x00000019 I would, but I have this thing...
0x0000001A Why didn't you ask me the first time? I'm out.
0x00000041 Thanks, Captain! We'll look forward to seeing your scans! 
0x00000042 Thanks, Captain! Whenever you're ready... 
0x00000043 The Grand Council thanks you. Please travel at once to ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000044 The Grand Council thanks you. Please leave at once.
0x00000045 Excellent! The stock market has already registered a gain! Travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and report back as soon as possible.
0x00000046 We'll start counting our profits!
0x00000047 Sooner rather than later. 
0x00000048 Hasten. We shall await your return.
0x00000049 Terrific news! Hie thyself thither straightaway!
0x0000004A You ~player_title~ have style! Have we mentioned this recently?
0x0000004B Leave at once, and do not return without the scans from ~mission_target_planet~.
0x0000004C Return to ~mission_target_planet~ immediately and return with ~mission_item~.
0x0000001B We'll chant for your success!
0x0000001C Thank you! We'd see you off, but we're due for an aura cleansing.
0x000000CE Excellent! Spode's Grand Design may move forward. Travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and report back as soon as possible.
0x000000CF May Spode lighten your burden!
0x000000D0 Thank you. Please report as soon as you return from ~mission_target_planet~.
0x000000D1 Thank you! We'll look forward to your return.
0x000000D2 Thank you for your cooperation. We shall look forward to your return from ~mission_target_planet~.
0x000000D3 Thank you. We appreciate your efforts on our behalf.
0x0000004D I'll be back soon.
0x0000004E Great! I shall not hesitate.
0x0000004F I'll be back in a jiff!
0x00000050 I'll be back before you know it!
0x0000001D An excellent job, Captain!
0x0000001E Excellent work in fetching the ~mission_item~! Please enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000001F The Grand Council thanks you for a thorough job. You are awarded a Certificate of Commendation, Third Class.
0x00000020 The Grand Council is pleased with your efforts. Please accept these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and this Certificate of Commendation, Second Class.
0x00000021 Your work was nothing short of magnificent, ~player_title~! We had no reason to expect anything less!
0x00000022 Our multiple hearts throb mightily at the thought of gain! You have brought the ~mission_item~! By all means take your well-earned ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and perhaps you'd like to wander through our emporium...?
0x00000023 Thank you, ~player_title~, for the honorable completion of this mission.
0x00000024 That was well done. Enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000025 Thanks for the nifty data, space-buddy! We'll sift through it and get back to you!
0x00000026 Excellent work! The party starts now! ~p~Have a pocket full of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, grab a snack, and find a chaise lounge by the pool!
0x00000027 We shall examine the data now. Further orders may be forthcoming.
0x000000D4 The ~mission_item~ is adequate for our purposes. If you desire ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, you may take them.
0x00000029 Thank you for your excellent work, ~player_title~. We detect a higher mind at work.
0x0000002A You must have been a highly advanced mystic master in a previous life! Please take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and perhaps you'd join us in a chant...?
0x000000D5 With Spode's blessing, the scans have arrived! Spode be praised!
0x000000D6 The Forty-First Prophecy has been fulfilled! You have helped to bring about the Grand Design! Please accept your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and perhaps you'd consider a tithe to the temple...?
0x000000D7 We thank you for this contribution to our understanding of the Galactic Life Web.
0x000000D8 Your work has been exemplary! Thank you for the ~mission_item~, and please accept your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x000000D9 The quality of your scans has surprised some of us, who hadn't expected such a sign of intelligence. Perhaps we will find you useful in the future.
0x000000DA The ~mission_item~ will be very useful. Enjoy these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and our enhanced estimate of your intelligence.
0x0000002B So, what do you want me to do next?
0x0000002C What's next on the agenda?
0x0000002D What's the next part of the mission?
0x0000002E So, what's next?
0x00000035 Good. I have something I'd like to discuss.
0x0000002F Where are the scans from ~mission_target_planet~? All relevant information should be in your Mission Log! Scan, and then return. 
0x00000030 We hate to carp, Captain, but didn't you say you'd bring us some ~mission_item~? The notes of the meeting should be in your Mission Log.
0x00000031 Where are the scans from ~mission_target_planet~? Haven't you completed the mission? Your agreement is recorded in your Mission Log. 
0x00000032 We are not yet in possession of a sufficient supply of ~mission_item~. As you had promised to bring us a supply, perhaps you should consult your Mission Log for details.
0x00000033 Where are our glorious profits? You haven't provided the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. All necessary information should be in your Mission Log! 
0x00000034 Here we are standing on all these great stacks of Sporebucks and you haven't brought the ~mission_item~?
0x00000036 You haven't returned with the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Did your Mission Log contain incomplete instructions?
0x00000037 We await your delivery of the ~mission_item~, as specified in your Mission Log. When can we expect the transfer?
0x00000038 We're trying not to be impatient, but we notice you haven't returned with your scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Look in your Mission Log if it's somehow slipped your mind. 
0x00000039 Say... where's the ~mission_item~? Time's a-wasting!
0x0000003A You have not returned with the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Check your Mission Log for the mission parameters. Scan, and then return. 
0x0000003B You had agreed to bring us ~mission_item~. This is witnessed by your Mission Log. You will bring us this item immediately.
0x0000003C After all our chanting, you still haven't got the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Could you check your Mission Log for the details and head straight there? 
0x000000DB We're all for people hanging loose and doing their own thing, but didn't you tell us you'd bring us some ~mission_item~? Our clairvoyants say that the information is in your Mission Log.
0x000000DC You haven't provided the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. All necessary information should be in your Mission Log! Spode's Grand Design must not be delayed!
0x000000DD Spode's Forty-First Prophecy remains incomplete! Look into your Mission Log as if it were a holy book, and fetch us the ~mission_item~ at once!
0x000000DE Where are the scans from ~mission_target_planet~? Your agreement to perform this task is available in your Mission Log, along with all relevant data. 
0x000000DF You were going to bring us a supply of ~mission_item~. Check your Mission Log for a record of our agreement.
0x000000E0 We were hoping to analyze the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. What went wrong? Have you clumsily deleted them from your Mission Log?
0x000000E1 We note that you have not returned with ~mission_item~, as you agreed. Have all the details been erased from your Mission Log?
0x0000003E I have something I'd like to discuss.
0x0000003F May I ask you a question?
0x00000040 One more thing before I'm off...
0x00000051 Just one other thing...
0x00000052 This isn't working out. I quit.
0x00000053 This mission is hard. I quit!
0x00000054 That's it for me. I'm done with this.
0x00000055 I give up. Sorry.
0x00000056 Right. I see now. Thanks.
0x00000057 Okay. I understand. Thank you.
0x00000058 Aha! Now I see. It's so simple now...
0x00000059 Ahh, I see now. Thanks greatly.
0x0000005A Well, this is a bit of a disappointment. We had hoped we could entice you. ~p~This mission may seem ordinary, but it's potentially *extremely* important to our species. ~p~It's a shame we'll have to put the job in less capable hands.
0x0000005B How could you do this!?! You don't know how crucial this next step of your mission is to us! ~p~Leave the job half done and maybe we should give your expensive spacecraft to someone who will use it better.
0x0000005C We will not insist. Goodbye. 
0x0000005D It is not in our interests to compel you.
0x0000005E We'll have to keep all the money for ourselves then. 
0x0000005F Not even the prospect of a great reward tempts you? You are unique in the galaxy!
0x00000060 You reject the opportunity for knowledge. Very well.
0x00000061 In that case we shall harvest this item ourselves.
0x00000062 Not interested? Not even a little bit? Oh well.
0x00000063 But you've been our perfect tool so far!
0x00000064 This refusal will bring penalties.
0x00000065 The galaxy is hazardous enough without defying the Grox.
0x00000066 I suppose we'll have to keep these spiritual riches to ourselves.
0x000000E2 Why stop now?
0x000000E3 Obviously it is not for infidels such as yourselves to further Spode's Grand Design.
0x000000E4 Surely Spode has not entered into your heart!
0x000000E5 We'll manage the scans ourselves then.
0x000000E6 That's unfortunate. We'll manage the work ourselves then, sooner or later.
0x000000E7 If you insist. Goodbye. 
0x000000E8 In that case, we shall manage this matter ourselves.
0x00000068 Let me ask you one more thing...
0x00000069 Can I ask you another question?
0x0000006A I'd like to discuss something else.
0x0000006B One more question before I go...
0x0000006C Ooh. Harsh. I'll see myself out.
0x0000006D Ouch. It doesn't have to be like that!
0x0000006E Yeah, well. See ya.
0x0000006F Well... Bye.
0x00000070 You're giving up? Your behavior is veering toward the peculiar side of the spectrum.
0x00000071 Perhaps you're suffering from overstrain. Take a chill pill and relax.
0x00000072 We shall take note of your irrational behavior. 
0x00000073 This is a ridiculous time to quit, but we won't force you.
0x00000074 You gave up? But... but... we had a contract! 
0x00000075 Alas, you are a highly unreliable trading partner. 
0x00000076 Honor is not served by this decision. 
0x00000077 Indecision is never an attractive quality.
0x00000078 Are you sure that we inhabit the same continuum?
0x00000079 This is no time to quit! When the party gets tough, the tough get partying! 
0x0000007A Your behavior is not without risk. 
0x0000007B If you cooperate, your death will be quick. If you do not cooperate, it may take longer.
0x0000007C For your species to behave this way, you must have taken on a staggering amount of bad karma.
0x000000E9 And some people have the nerve to call us trivial! 
0x000000EA Spode shall take note of anyone interfering with his Grand Design.
0x000000EB Those who foil the Grand Design should beware. 
0x000000EC Consistency is all we ask. Unfortunately, you're not very consistent.
0x000000ED Your mental processes seem a perfect example of chaos system theory.
0x000000EE Your illogical behavior furnishes yet another data point in our estimation of your species' intelligence, which was not very high to begin with. 
0x000000EF The most charitable interpretation possible is that you're suffering from a virus that produces stupidity.
0x0000007E Dang! That's harsh.
0x0000007F I don't have to listen to this...
0x00000080 I... uhh.. I'll be going...
0x00000081 Well, wow. You don't have to be mean.
0x00000087 Simple errand too much? Truly, you require the Light of Spode to find your way. 
0x00000088 Were the terms of the mission not clear enough? Never mind. We shall send a survey ship which shall succeed where you have failed.
0x00000089 We would offer you a remedial flying class back to ~mission_target_planet~, but we lack the time. Farewell.
0x0000008A You came. You saw. You did... something, we're sure. 
0x0000008B You were thwarted by what? Perhaps you may find intelligence on sale in our bazaar.
0x0000008C Your failure is incomprehensible. Goodbye.
0x0000008D You came. You saw. You did... something, we're sure. 
0x00000096 Those distant beings must have put up a powerful spiritual screen to blind you. Or maybe you just weren't very bright to begin with. 
0x0000008E The best that we can say about your failure is that it is unprecedented. Farewell.
0x0000008F You haven't finished the job at ~mission_target_planet~. We can't keep news this bad from leaking to the press.
