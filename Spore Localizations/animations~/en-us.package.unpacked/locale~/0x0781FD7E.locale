0x00000000 I  just received a top priority emergency distress signal from Colonel Farkus.~p~He's putting on a rock concert in the park and his lead singer is...huh? Wait a secton! This isn't an emergency! How many times do I have to tell Farkus not to call me on my hotline?~p~Uhh...could you do me a favor and take care of this?
0x00000041 Colonel Farkus told me the concert was a hit, thanks to you! I don't suppose you smuggled out a bootleg holochip recording for me, did you?~p~Here's ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks for doing such a rockin' job!
0x0000004E Colonel Farkus is a swell guy, but I can't come to his rescue every time one of his singers throws a tantrum. Could you please handle this for me?
