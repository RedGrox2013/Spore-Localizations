0x00000001 Ah yes! Captain ~player_creature_name~!~p~As you know from your exploration of the universe, we were very lucky to find such a nice planet on which to establish our colony.~p~If we are going to become a galactic force, we must learn how to improve the atmosphere and temperature of a planet.~p~This can make a sub-optimal planet ideal for colonization.~p~Completing this mission will earn you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000002 Could you explain terraforming a bit?
0x00000003 I'm new to terraforming. What do I do?
0x00000004 I don't know how to terraform anything.
0x00000005 How can I terraform?
0x00000049 I'm actually a little busy right now.
0x0000004A Can I do this later?
0x0000004B I'm not going to do this right now, for several reasons.
0x0000004C Wait. Hold that thought.
0x0000004D I'm kinda in the middle of something else.
0x0000000B Basically, terraforming is like adjusting a planetary thermostat and humidifier. Get the water-level and temperature just so, and voila! - you have a habitable planet. Bring the terraform score of planet ~mission_target_planet~ to a T-Score of ~mission_terraform_target_score~, making it much more hospitable for colonies.
0x0000000C How do I do that?
0x0000000D How is that possible? 
0x0000000E Exactly how would I do that?
0x0000000F Such power! Tell me more!
0x00000006 I'm actually a little busy right now.
0x00000007 Can I do this later?
0x00000008 I'm not going to do this right now, for several reasons.
0x00000009 Wait. Hold that thought.
0x0000000A I'm kinda in the middle of something else.
0x00000010 The power to control a planet's T-Score is something we are just beginning to understand.~p~We will give you a few basic tools to help you in your efforts. Use them wisely. They're all we have.
0x00000011 Okay. Give me the tools!
0x00000012 I'm up for the challenge!
0x00000013 Anything else?
0x00000014 Use the tool to improve the T-Score. Got it.
0x00000015 I'm actually a little busy right now.
0x00000016 Can I do this later?
0x00000017 I'm not going to do this right now, for several reasons.
0x00000018 Wait. Hold that thought.
0x00000019 I'm kinda in the middle of something else.
0x0000001A One more thing.~p~You will need to fill the Food Web, using the specimens from your cargo.~p~A population of plants and animals is what keeps a planet's T-Score stabilized. Make sure you place plants first.~p~If you run out of specimens, come back and we will supply you with more.
0x0000001B I can do that. Where?
0x0000001C Terraforming sounds terrific! Which planet?
0x0000001D Any particular planet in mind?
0x0000001E Very exciting! Do you have a planet picked out?
0x0000001F I'm actually a little busy right now.
0x00000020 Can I do this later?
0x00000021 I'm not going to do this right now, for several reasons.
0x00000022 Wait. Hold that thought.
0x00000023 I'm kinda in the middle of something else.
0x00000024 We've identified a suitable candidate for terraforming, which would make any colony proud to call home.~p~Don't you think ~mission_target_planet~ of the ~mission_target_star~ system is a perfect choice?
0x00000025 With a little clean-up, it just might do!
0x00000026 I'll check it out. How bad can it be?
0x00000027 If you say so. I'm in!
0x00000028 I'm all for expansion! Let's do it!
0x00000029 I'm actually a little busy right now.
0x0000002A Can I do this later?
0x0000002B I'm not going to do this right now, for several reasons.
0x0000002C Wait. Hold that thought.
0x0000002D I'm kinda in the middle of something else.
0x0000002E Wonderful!~p~Have a safe flight to the ~mission_target_star~ system!~p~We look forward to your successful return and the interplanetary expansion of our people.
0x00000050 One more thing before I go...
0x0000005F Oh, one more thing...
0x00000060 Hey, one other thing...
0x0000002F Be well... and prosper!
0x00000030 Excelsior!
0x00000031 Wish me luck!
0x00000032 May the Spore be with you!
0x00000033 ~mission_target_star~ system, here I come!
0x0000006F We'd like to send you on your way, but we've hit a slight snag. In order to take this mission you'll need to make sure you have enough room in your Cargo Bin for all of the plants and animals you'll be taking along.~p~Discard items in your Cargo Bin to make room.~p~Come back when you're ready Captain.  
0x00000070 One more thing before I go...
0x00000071 Oh, one more thing...
0x00000072 Hey, one other thing...
0x00000073 I'll be back soon enough.
0x00000034 Great job! Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is temperate and beautiful now. My grandparents are even thinking of a winter vacation home there.~p~Here is a token of our appreciation: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000035 I'd like to discuss something else...
0x00000036 Bye.
0x00000039 The planet ~mission_target_planet~ remains uninhabitable.~p~Raise the T-Score of the planet enough to gain the ability to place plants. Using plants from your cargo, place them on the planet to stabilize the atmosphere.
0x00000061 One more thing before I go...
0x00000062 Oh, one more thing...
0x00000063 Hey, one other thing...
0x0000003A I'll do it, but now I'm hungry.
0x0000003B I will prepare planet ~mission_target_planet~ for good living! 
0x0000003C I will make sure planet ~mission_target_planet~ is ready to take your order!
0x0000003D Got it. Colonial shake-and-bake. You want chips with that?
0x0000003E Captain! Do you think so little of our overpopulation problems that you're content to aimlessly trawl the universe? Well, maybe after you 'find yourself' or whatever, return to save your species!
0x00000064 One more thing before I go...
0x00000065 Oh, one more thing...
0x00000066 Hey, one other thing...
0x0000003F Maybe. Maybe not.
0x00000040 I'll probably be back.
0x00000041 Don't be that way. I'll be back.
0x00000042 I have issues. I'll be right back.
0x00000037 Go on. What do you need?
0x00000038 What am I supposed to do again?
0x00000043 I need more of those tools you gave me.
0x00000045 ...
0x00000046 I'm having a small issue with terraforming...
0x00000047 You wasted them?!!~p~Here are some more, but it's going to cost you ~tool_cost~ Sporebucks. Be careful with those.~p~They don't grow on trees!
0x00000058 We'd give you more terraforming tools, but it costs ~tool_cost~ Sporebucks and you don't seem to have enough.~p~Come back when you have enough Sporebucks.
0x00000067 One more thing before I go...
0x00000068 Oh, one more thing...
0x00000069 Hey, one other thing...
0x00000048 Understood. Thanks!
