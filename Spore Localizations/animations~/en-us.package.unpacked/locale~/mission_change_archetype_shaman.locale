0x00000001 Indeed my friend, if you wish to be like us, then you shall become like us. Though it is not a decision to be taken lightly. As in all things you must determine if it is your true calling.

0x00000002 We believe in harmonic balance.

With this we can easily teleport back to our home world where we can learn from our elders among whom all knowledge lies.
