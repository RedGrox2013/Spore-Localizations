0x00000001 One of our probes has alerted us to the existence of another space faring civilization at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Our own resources are overcommitted, so perhaps you would consider making contact on our behalf?
0x00000002 Recently-decoded signals from planet ~mission_target_planet~ indicate that it may be home to a star-spanning civilization. We have yet to determine where this species fits into the galactic life-web. ~p~Would you help us investigate?
0x00000003 A new interstellar civilization has been located at planet ~mission_target_planet~. We don't know whether or not they have developed any ecological-awareness.~p~Would you help us determine this?
0x00000004 Some species are more ready than others to embrace the Way of Spode. We have discovered another space faring civilization on planet ~mission_target_planet~ that may be ripe for conversion, but before we make formal contact we would like to investigate their nature.~p~Would you advance the Way of Spode by helping us? 
0x00000005 Spode has revealed to us the existence of an interstellar civilization! Before we launch our legions of missionaries to planet ~mission_target_planet~, we need to learn more about their spiritual aptitude.~p~Will you help us?
0x00000006 We have discovered a star faring civilization on planet ~mission_target_planet~ that is without knowledge of Spode. Can you bring us a member of this species, so that he can be trained as a missionary to bring enlightenment to its people?
0x00000007 The Grand Council is always pleased to welcome additional species into our Federation. We have discovered just such a species on nearby planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~Would you aid us in making contact?
0x00000008 Years ago the Grand Council wisely created a sensor array capable of detecting signs of intelligent life on other stars. We have recently discovered signals from what appear to be a space faring civilization on planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~Would you aid us in finding out as much as possible about this new species?
0x00000009 We desire that all intelligent species live in peace and security within our federation. One of our unmanned probes recently discovered the existence of a new space faring species on planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~Would you be interested in helping us learn about them?
0x0000000A Data suggests that the galaxy may be teeming with life! New evidence has reached us that a new star faring civilization has been located in the ~mission_target_star~ system. The capabilities of this new species are unknown, but we believe you are more advanced than they.~p~Would you be willing to advance the cause of interstellar amity by helping us investigate this new race? 
0x0000000B Our receivers have detected spectra from ~mission_target_star~ that suggests that someone there has developed a drive capable of powering interstellar vessels. This race may be newly arrived on the galactic scene.~p~Would you be interested in helping us find out more about our new neighbors?
0x0000000C One of our unmanned probes has failed to return from the ~mission_target_star~ system. For decades we have been observing a wide spectrum of radio emissions from planet ~mission_target_planet~ for decades, and if they could destroy one of our probes, then it is very likely that they have developed the capability for star travel.~p~Will you aid us in our investigation of this mystery?
0x0000000D It's a big sandbox out there, and we may have just found a new playmate! ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ seems to be occupied by a space faring civilization!~p~Can you pay a little visit to these aliens, bonk one on the head, and bring him here so we can find out if he's going to play fair with us?
0x0000000E The natives of planet ~mission_target_planet~ have completely embraced the zooming-around-the-galaxy lifestyle! ~p~We don't know if these folk are going to be our friends or not, so we'd like you to bring one of them around for a chat, n'est-ce pas?
0x0000000F There's a space-capable species on planet ~mission_target_planet~. They're still so wet behind the ears that we can probably get away with one of our classic pranks. ~p~What we'd like you to do is find an isolated member of the species, preferably with a lower-than-average intelligence, grab him, and bring him to us for intrusive medical experiments. Then we'll release him back into his native environment, where he'll wander around babbling about his trip to another world, and absolutely no one will believe him! ~p~Does this sound like fun to you?
0x00000010 It saddens us to trouble beings of such magnificence as yourselves with a matter as paltry as this, but we thought we might mention that we have discovered another star faring civilization not far from here on planet ~mission_target_planet~! As we are a shy and retiring people, we would prefer someone else to make initial contact on our behalf. ~p~Would you consider aiding us in exchange for vast and splendid rewards?
0x00000011 This insignificant creature hesitates to trouble your patience, but we thought that you might wish to know that a star faring civilization has been discovered on a planet orbiting ~mission_target_star~. We desire nothing so much as their happiness! ~p~We need to know more about this people, so that we can design consumer items that will bring them delight! ~p~Can you help us in our investigations?
0x00000012 We prance and drool at the possibility of a new market! A star faring civilization has been discovered at planet ~mission_target_planet~. We need to learn more about them before we can design consumer items for them. ~p~Will you help us, in exchange for generous compensation?
0x00000013 One of our seers had a vision of an Enlightened Master from planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~Can you travel there, see if anyone lives there, take one of the natives (if they exist), and bring it here so that we can ask it about its world's spiritual advancement? 
0x00000014 One of our great psychic channelers has a spirit guide named Maxx, who says he is from planet ~mission_target_planet~. We're sure there is a highly advanced star faring civilization there!~p~Would it be possible for you to travel to there, gently abduct one of the natives, and bring it here for a birthday surprise for Maxx?
0x00000015 We have received emanations from planet ~mission_target_planet~, which suggest they may have developed a means of traveling between the stars. We don't know if they're spiritually advanced or crass materialists. Can you bring us one of these beings, so that we could find out more about his civilization?
0x00000016 New evidence suggests that a star faring civilization may be based in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Would you help us investigate? 
0x00000017 We have discovered a new star faring civilization living on planet ~mission_target_planet~. We would like to evaluate the military capability of this species, and its penchant for aggression. We wonder if you would be of service?
0x00000018 A star faring civilization has been discovered living on planet ~mission_target_planet~. As they have so far rebuffed all our attempts to contact them, we wonder if you would handle that delicate matter on our behalf?
0x0000012B An interstellar organic species may be found at planet ~mission_target_planet~. You are required to bring us one of this species.
0x0000012C An intelligent organic species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ lacks knowledge of the Grox. We wish to keep them in ignorance, so you will travel there on our behalf.
0x0000012D A space faring species is based at planet ~mission_target_planet~. You will help us evaluate this threat.
0x0000012E We've reason to believe that a star faring civilization may be found at planet ~mission_target_planet~. We'd like you to make the first contact!
0x0000012F Our detector array suggests that planet ~mission_target_planet~ may be host to a space faring civilization! We would like you to approach them. 
0x00000130 We may have discovered a space faring species at planet ~mission_target_planet~. We need you to discover whether they are a threat to our species!
0x0000001C I accept your proposal.
0x00000019 This seems doable. I accept
0x00000029 I can totally handle that.
0x00000078 I will do what you bid.
0x00000079 Oh no! I'm not putting one of THOSE in my cargo hold!
0x0000007A Actually, I've just realized how busy I am.
0x0000007B Alas, I must reject this request.
0x0000001A I regret that I must decline.
0x0000001B I can't. I'm busy.
0x0000001D We'd like you to travel to the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. Remove a suitable citizen from planet ~mission_target_planet~ and bring it here, so that we may discover whether this species are aggressively resource-hungry or whether they live in harmony with nature. 
0x0000001E A star faring civilization has been discovered in the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. We desire that you abduct a member of their species and bring them to us here, so that we may investigate how best to bring this species into Spode's holy harmony. ~p~We desire that, insofar as this is possible, this mission be accomplished in peace.
0x0000001F A star faring culture had been located in the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. Please investigate, retrieve a citizen of their civilization, and bring that individual here so that the Grand Council may begin communication with this new species.  
0x00000020 The new civilization seems to be centered in the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. Please enter the system, take a member of this new species, and bring it here.~p~We hope that violence may remain at a minimum. If there is trouble, please don't mention our involvement.
0x00000021 This exciting opportunity requires that you journey to the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. Please recruit a member of their civilization and return this person to our current location, where we may investigate the species and determine what consumer items it may find suitable. 
0x00000022 Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~. Grab one of the natives and bring it here. ~p~Try not to start an interstellar war, that would spoil the fun.  
0x00000023 Travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~. If there is a civilization there, take one of the natives and bring it to us. ~p~Do not employ violence or otherwise disturb the natives. 
0x00000024 It is wiser to act from knowledge than from ignorance. Hence reconnaissance is an important virtue. ~p~The new civilization is in the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. Please fetch one of the natives to us here. ~p~If there is violence, do not call upon us to help.  
0x00000131 This species may be found on a planet orbiting ~mission_target_empire_home_star~. Go there, acquire one of the natives, and bring it here. ~p~We are indifferent to any violence that may occur. 
0x00000132 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ orbits ~mission_target_empire_home_star~. Travel there, beam up one of the natives, and bring it here.~p~Try not to start an interstellar war while you're doing this.
0x00000025 I Accept
0x0000007C Okay. This should be really interesting
0x0000007D I'm on it
0x0000007F Abducting someone from a space faring planet. That's asking for trouble.
0x00000080 This is way too risky for me
0x00000081 This isn't in my line of work, sorry.
0x00000048 I must regretfully decline.
0x0000002E You have returned to your people victorious! This ~mission_item~ cements the ~race~ as players on the intergalactic stage! For your efforts, please accept ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000002F Look everyone - the handsome and fearless astro-hero has returned with the ~mission_item~! Doesn't he look great? Have you been working out? You look especially svelte. Anyway, we offer you a payment of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks for your exemplary work.
0x00000030 The ~mission_item~ specimen - you have it! Inconceivable! Even though my people suffer from hypoglycemia and hemophilia, we have been selling our blood and other fluids in order to pay you the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks we owe.
0x00000031 That coulda been quicker! You get lost in another universe or something? You got the ~mission_item~? Hey, it's slightly scuffed! Is that chipped paint? What's this stain? Well, I guess it's not *completely* ruined - here's ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000032 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. O, noble and intrepid explorer - you have brought us the ~mission_item~! The people of ~planet_name~ have retired to their parlor-rooms, busily composing sonnets and song of your most heroic travails! Our payment of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks alone is not adequate tribute. Perhaps you will come to our open mic night next month?
0x00000033  ~player_creature_name~. ChkChkChk. Specimen obtained. ~mission_item~ transfer to ~race~ complete. Payment tendered: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. Business Concluded. End.
0x00000026 Thank you! We hope that we will be able to ally with this new species, and help enlarge the galaxy's biomass. Please take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000027 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Our interrogation of the native will begin at once! Soon another civilization will bask in the Light of Spode. Your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks await you, along with this free copy of our holy book.
0x00000028 The Grand Council permits me to offer its congratulations. You are also authorized a Certificate of Commendation, First Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000002A ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Our exobiologists are enthralled by the chance to render this being into long chains of data! Please take these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and rest assured that you have advanced the cause of civilization. 
0x0000002B Thank you for bringing our new little friend! We just know we'll get along. In the meantime, you can get along with your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000002C How splendid! Our factories will work overtime producing beads and tonics for this new civilization. Please take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and a tour through the emporium.
0x0000002D You have brought us one of the galaxy's glorious wonders in the form of a living, intelligent being! Enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and feel free to join us for the Ceremony of Awakening.
0x00000034 That was done well. We may employ you on other missions, and in the meantime take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x00000133  ~player_creature_name~. The creature is fit for examination. In return, you will accept ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x00000134 Thanks, Captain! With luck, this new race will be our allies! You've earned your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x00000035 You are most welcome. Before I go...
0x00000082 What else can I do for you?
0x00000083 I see a future in this kind of work. Would there be anything else???
0x00000039 A pleasure to help. So long.
0x0000003A No trouble at all. Farewell.
0x0000003B Anytime. See you later.
0x0000003C You are most generous. 
0x00000036 We were hoping that you would bring us a citizen from planet ~mission_target_planet~, which orbits ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. Your Mission Log verifies that you promised to help us. Will you complete your task?
0x00000037 We have not yet seen a native of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you keep your promise and bring us the unenlightened? They are in the ~mission_empire_home_star~ system. Your Mission Log will give you all the details.  
0x00000038 The Grand Council was counting on meeting the new ambassador from the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ star system. All parameters are available in your Mission Log. Will you deliver him to us?
0x00000046 Must we remind you of your obligation to bring us a native of the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system? Look in your Mission Log if your species' memory is defective in this matter.
0x0000004A Weren't you going to bring a native of the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system around for tea and cookies? Your Mission Log will give you all the details.  
0x000000BB Where is the ambassador from the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system? We have so many gifts for him! Surely a being of your intelligence has not forgotten what has been promised? All details are recorded in your Mission Log.
0x0000003D We seem to remember that you were going to fetch us a being from the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. Did they put up a psychic barrier? If not, check your Mission Log for details.  
0x0000003E We still lack a native of the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system? All parameters are to be found in your Mission Log... what is the matter?
0x00000135 Where is the native of the~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system? All mission parameters are to be found in your Mission Log.
0x00000136 Where is the native of the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system? Check your Mission Log for all the relevant information!
0x0000004B I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000004C Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000004D Also...
0x0000004E One more thing...
0x0000004F I give up.
0x00000050 I need to decline this task.
0x00000051 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000052 I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000053 I've got it this time. Farewell!
0x00000054 Thank you again. So long.
0x00000055 I will return shortly... this time for real. So long.
0x00000056 The task is well overdue. I am off!
0x0000003F This new species seems to be very formidable. Or is it that your species is weaker than we were led to believe?
0x00000040 These beings are inspired by the forces of darkness! Soon they shall confront the Fire of Spode!
0x00000041 Though the Grand Council is disappointed in this outcome, in thanks for your attempt we are prepared to offer you a Certificate of Mention, Third Class.
0x00000042 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Don't despair at your lack of success. After all, you yourselves are a constant source of data... our analysts will be able to discover much about you from the records of your failure.  
0x00000043 All you had to do was sneak up and grab her! Do the aliens have some kind of super weapon, or were you clumsy on that day?
0x00000044 Your failure has shown that we were right not to contact this tempestuous new species. By way of compensation, please visit our bazaar.
0x00000045 The natives of star system ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ must have thrown up some kind of metaphysical cloaking device, otherwise you could have fulfilled your mission easily. Did they affect your brain permanently, or are you okay again?
0x00000047 Your ineptitude is noted. 
0x00000137  ~player_creature_name~. You have failed a simple mission. We calculate that your species will not long survive. 
0x00000138 You haven't brought us an alien? We're so disappointed! 
0x00000060 I'm sorry. Can we discuss something else...
0x00000061 Yes, there were complications...
0x00000062 This wasn't my best work...
0x00000063 Let's focus on the future...
0x00000049 I need to move on. Farewell.
0x000000BC Sorry I must go now. 
0x00000064 I beg your understanding.
0x000000BD Thank you. Please remember that this is a peaceful mission and that a war would be in no one's interests. 
0x000000BE Leave for ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ star system at once, and let the blessings of Spode go with you!
0x000000BF We look forward to your bringing us the ambassador from a new species. ~p~Should this turn out badly, please don't mention us to anyone.
0x000000C0 Please depart for the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. We appreciate your willingness to help.
0x000000C1 Book passage for the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system, and we'll ready our hospitality for our new guest!
0x000000C2 We drool and glibber with delight! Please bring us an ambassador from the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system, at once. ~p~Try not to kill anyone by mistake or start a war. Conflict depresses our markets.
0x000000C3 Thanks for volunteering to travel to the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. We'll look forward to your return with our new guest!
0x00000057 Leave at once for the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system. We shall await your return. 
0x00000139 Depart at once for the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ system.  
0x0000013A Excellent! Leave for the ~mission_target_empire_home_star~ star system as soon as possible!
0x00000073 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000074 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000075 Also...
0x00000076 One more thing...
0x00000077 I should be off. Farewell!
0x000000C4 Thank you for the opportunity. So long.
0x000000C5 I will return shortly. So long.
0x000000C6 The task is at hand. Farewell.
0x00000058 In that case, we won't keep you. Goodbye. 
0x00000059 In that case, we have no further business. Go in peace... for now.
0x0000005A The Grand Council will not insist. Farewell.
0x0000005B Perhaps your species is capable of cunning, after all.
0x0000005C You're no fun at all! 
0x0000005D Oh well. I suppose we'll have to contact this potential ally ourselves. 
0x0000005E You won't go to star system ~mission_target_empire_home_star~? Was it because you feel a psychic foreboding, or were you just not in the mood?
0x0000005F Are you afraid of contacting this new race? Perhaps you should be more afraid of us.
0x0000013B Defiance will not secure the future of your species.
0x0000013C You don't want to kidnap anyone? Do we really want a minor ethical issue interfering with our grand design?
0x00000089 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000008A Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000008B Also...
0x0000008C One more thing...
0x0000006B I'm sure you can sort it out yourselves. Gotta go...
0x00000071 This will all be forgotten. I must depart.
0x00000084 Don't worry yourselves. I will return someday.
0x00000085 My services are required elsewhere.
0x00000086 Tomorrow's another day. I must be off.
0x00000087 Don't you have more important things to attend to? I do.
0x00000088 This isn't the right time for this job. I must be going.
0x0000008D We can sort this out later. Until next time...
0x0000008E We regret we can't do this right now. Please excuse us.
0x0000008F No. I have more urgent matters to attend to. I'll be back.
0x00000090 We won't hold it against you that this mission is so completely outside your capabilities. Goodbye.
0x00000091 Your treacherous species will soon learn what it means to defy the Will of Spode. 
0x00000096 Are you in league against us with this new species? If so, we recommend that you reconsider.  
0x00000097 Your antics of your species will prove a source of morbid amusement at our next psychologists' convention. 
0x00000065 Your feather-light little brains just blow with the wind, don't they? 
0x00000066 You really are a complete sham, aren't you? Goodbye. 
0x00000067 Although we are a tolerant people, we're reaching our limits where you are concerned.
0x00000068 There is a special hell reserved for the dishonorable. 
0x0000013D Defiance of our commands is rewarded only with pain. 
0x0000013E You're giving up? Did they shoot at you or something? 
0x00000098 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000099 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000009A Also...
0x0000009B One more thing...
0x0000009C I'm sure you can sort it out yourselves.
0x0000009D This will all be forgotten.
0x0000009E Don't worry yourselves.
0x0000009F My services are required elsewhere.
0x000000A0 Tomorrow's another day.
0x000000A1 Don't you have more important things to attend to?
0x000000A2 This isn't the right time for this job.
0x000000A3 We can sort this out later.
0x000000A4 We regret we can't do this right now.
0x000000A5 No. I have more urgent matters to attend to.
0x000000A7 ...
0x000000A8 Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x000000A9 I need to review my mission.
0x000000AA The details of my mission have escaped me.
0x000000AB I'd like to review the details of my mission.
0x000000AC Restate your request. My notes are unclear.
0x000000A6 Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x0000006A Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000AD Also...
0x000000AE One more thing...
0x000000AF I'd rather do something else.
0x0000007E I need to decline this task.
0x000000B0 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x000000B1 I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000092 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x00000093 Until we speak again. So long.
0x00000094 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x00000095 I beg your understanding. 
0x000000B2 Find a citizen of the ~mission_target_empire~.
0x00000069 Return to planet ~mission_source_planet~.
0x0000006E Failed. Go back to planet ~mission_source_planet~.
0x000000B3 Locate planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ star system. 
0x000000B4 This planet is in the ~mission_source_star~ system.
