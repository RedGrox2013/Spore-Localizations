0x00000007 Greetings. Your ship is not in our data records.~p~What is your identification and registration information?
0x00000010 Hello, most welcome visitor. Please present your documents and requisite approval forms.
0x00000011 The Grand Council of the ~race~ greets you.~p~We are pleased to make the acquaintance of another intelligent species. May we have your information and documentation please?
0x00000012 Are you Food?
0x0000001C We are the ~race~.~p~You are not, but we hope you're at least amusing.
0x0000001D Ho! The universe has tossed up another new species, still wet from the egg!~p~We think you're cute! Can we play with you?
0x00000005 Are you Food?
0x0000001E O, the glorious heavens shine their countenance upon the ~race~! Another alien society has deemed us worthy of first contact! This is truly the most auspicious of occasions! We shall sup on the finest and most fragrant foods! We shall sing! We shall dance, and make merry!~p~And lastly, we shall scrapbook furiously, so that future generations may know of this great day!
0x00000050 Friend. Who goes there?
0x00000051 A new galactic presence is felt. Welcome.~p~What are you called?
0x00000052 Your shape is unfamiliar, friend.~p~By what are you known?
0x00000053 We see that the well of nature... flowing with life force of all things... has produced another intelligent species. Greetings!~p~In the ~race~, we believe that a place for all exists within the Galactic Life Web. Live in harmony with nature, and we can make our journeys together. What may we call you friend?
0x00000054 Wondrous well... new life presents itself to the ~race~... most welcome are you... What are you called?
0x00000055 Welcome... dear fellow life form... it's nice just to enjoy each other, isn't it... Let's savor this moment...~p~What may we call you?
0x00000003 Welcome... dear fellow life form... it's nice just to enjoy each other, isn't it... Let's savor this moment...~p~What may we call you?
0x00000057 Welcome, welcome! Always a pleasure, pleasure to see a friend again. Wait, wait, don't tell me... I know I have your information around here somewhere. We've met before yes? I'd never forget a ship as interesting as yours...
0x0000005F Welcome, welcome and again welcome. That's a very interesting ship you have. I'd love to talk to your engineers. Fascinating, fascinating. You must give me your details.
0x00000063 Oh, my! You startled us! You really should give a species fair warning when you intend to make first contact. What if the entire ~race~ had a fainting spell. It's happened before, you know. When we came to, we discovered mischievous aliens had drawn terrible things on our faces. In permanent marker!
0x00000002 Welcome, welcome! Always a pleasure, pleasure to meet another friend, provided you are a friend of course...~p~Give us your name?
0x0000000C We are in awe! ~player_creature_name~ strides among the stars like a race of giants!~p~We are the ~race~! We believe that the universal currency is happiness, and that the best way to achieve happiness is through free and unencumbered trade, in which each party agrees on the exchange and is made happier by the result!~p~How can we make you happy? Perhaps you would like to pass your eyes across the items in our emporium?
0x00000064 Hold. The magnificent ~race~, followers of the truth, crusaders of right, will consider your character.~p~Who do you present yourself to be?
0x00000066 Halt in the name of the ~race~. All travelers must submit for inspection of fortitude.~p~State your name and be known to the supreme ~race~. 
0x0000000D Unenlightened visitor. You are in the presence of the planet of the mighty ~race~.~p~Who do you presume yourself to be and the ~race~ will consider you.
0x00000067 Fascinating alien life form. What are you called?
0x00000068 Curious DNA structure. Are you able to speak?
0x00000069 Ah, another undocumented species. Wonderful. Do give us your information.
0x0000000E In the name of reason, we send you greetings.~p~In the ~race~, we subject all propositions to the light of observation, experimentation, and hard empirical truth. The universe provides its own answers to those clever enough to find them.~p~May we aid you on your task of discovery?
0x0000006A Halt. Identify yourself.
0x0000006C You stop. Give name.
0x00000004 Alien, who is you?
0x0000006D What!? What do you want?~p~It seems like there's always some new galactic whippersnapper buzzin' in our ear, wantin' to make contact with the ~race~.~p~Well, fine, but you listen good: you stay off our lawns!~p~And any Frisbees we find there, we're keeping!
0x0000008A Identify yourself.
0x0000008C Identify.
0x0000008E Ship unknown. Identify.
0x00000013 You are in the security zone of the ~race~. The Grand Council requires that you state your business.
0x0000019E The Grand Council wishes to know what you are doing here.
0x0000019F The Grand Council views your existence with grave concern.
0x00000014 Shall we eat you now?
0x000001A0 What are you boring little people doing here, exactly?
0x000001A1 You're giving us a splitting headache! 
0x00000015 We stand ready to guard the Universal Life Web from despoilers such as you.
0x0000028C Nature is our guide, and to us you seem unnatural.
0x0000028D We are the ~race~. We stand against your aggression and your unnatural lifestyle.
0x00000016 We are the ~race~. Perhaps you would volunteer to be dissected?
0x0000028E We in the ~race~ are devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and reason. We're not sure you meet this standard, however.
0x0000028F You're an interesting specimen. We'd like to see you on a slab.
0x00000290 We in the ~race~ have accepted the Word of Spode, and you have not. What could we possibly have in common?
0x00000291 Our civilization sings the praises of Spode, who brought us truth and enlightenment. You, however, remain in darkness. What do you want with us?
0x00000017 Unless you accept the Word of Spode, we are not destined to walk in harmony. 
0x00000018 We are disturbed that a being of your splendor notices us at all. Why don't you go away?
0x00000292 We are too mean and insignificant for your notice. Why don't you go somewhere else...? Unless of course you want to spend lots of money in our bazaar?
0x00000293 Take warning! Our emporium contains many weapons which the ~race~ will use to defend ourselves!~p~Of course, we also sell these, if the price is right.
0x00000019 We want to finish this conversation business before your bad karma drops an anvil on your head.
0x00000294 Your aura is so... hostile. Removing you would abolish a major source of bad vibrations.
0x00000295 All you did was show up, and now all our clairvoyants are chanting, 'Kill, kill!'
0x0000001A Pay no attention to the many large weapons pointed directly at your brain. They are here for your protection.
0x00000296 State your case for continued existence.
0x00000297 The ~race~ are a reasonable people. We reason that your species might soon be crushed beneath our military might.
0x00000000 I am from the ~player_creature_name~. I come in peace.
0x00000061 Behold! I am from the great and mighty planet ~player_homeworld~.
0x00000062 Call off your fighter before I blast it into pieces.
0x0000007A Wait! Perhaps some money could end this war.
0x00000079 I'll see you on the galactic battlefield!
0x00000001 Greetings Captain. Your colony on planet ~planet_name~ is up and running!~p~It's a pleasure to speak to you directly.
0x0000011D Hail Captain! We have arrived on planet ~planet_name~ safely and are starting the unpacking process.~p~We're eager to start our Spice mining operation. As you know, if you invest in adding more buildings to the colony, it would help increase productivity. 
0x0000011F Greetings Captain! Planet ~planet_name~ appears to be a fine place to start a colony.~p~We look forward to serving you and our Empire. 
0x00000121 Good to hear from you Captain! Our colonizing operation appears to be going well on planet ~planet_name~.~p~Feel free to add more buildings to increase our productivity. 
0x00000122 Good day Captain! It appears you have made an excellent choice of planets to colonize.~p~Planet ~planet_name~ will be an excellent location to mine spice and establish a foothold in the galaxy. 
0x00000655 Congratulations, Colony of ~planet_name~! May our Empire continue to grow and prosper.
0x0000001B Hail Captain ~player_creature_name~! Your home world of ~race_homeworld~ welcomes you with open arms.~p~I expect your journeys have produced quite a few tall tales. The whole of ~race_homeworld~ awaits news of your adventures. Please, tell us all you have seen and done.
0x0000001F Well, lookit that. It looks like our favorite explorer has come a-callin'. It's always great to see a fellow ~player_creature_name~ way out here in the colonies. I hope you brought your appetite, 'cause we aim to fix you up a mess o'grub!
0x00000298 In the name of the Grand Council, we greet our friend, ~player_title~.
0x00000299 The Grand Council is pleased to welcome ~player_title~ to the home of the ~race~.
0x0000029A The Grand Council is pleased to greet its friend, ~player_title~.
0x00000020 Ahh, it's always a pleasure to receive a visit from one of our interstellar comrades.~p~How goes it?
0x0000002A In the name of the Grand Council, we greet you.
0x0000029B The ~race~ find ~player_title~'s antics an endless source of amusement! Welcome!
0x0000029C It's the cute little ~player_title~ come back! We can have fun playing with the cute little ~player_title~!
0x0000029D Your civilization is all grown up! Little ~player_title~ should be proud!
0x0000002B Are you ready to be eaten yet?
0x00000024 Well met, ~player_creature_name~! The ~race~ find you hearty and hale, no doubt? You must regale us with your many travails of derring-do and gallantry among the stars! We hang on your every breath! Our own tales will seem as bromides by comparison!
0x00000039 Hark! From the very periphery of the Hubble volume itself, our noble hero from afar returns! How goes it? Do tell! Soon, all of ~race_homeworld~ shall be abuzz with stories of your exploits among the stars!
0x0000029E The ~race~ send you greetings, wanderer! ~player_title~, we perceive your benevolent aura.
0x0000029F How are you, friend ~player_title~? May we balance your yin and yang?
0x000002A0 Greetings, seeker ~player_title~. The ~race~ are pleased to greet you.
0x0000002C Child of Eternity, we perceive your aura.
0x000002A1 Greetings, Child of Nature. We are pleased to see our friend, ~player_title~.
0x000002A2 Welcome to our sylvan abode, ~player_title~.
0x000002A3 ~player_title~ is welcome to join us in our worldly paradise.
0x0000002D Greetings, Child of Nature.
0x00000027 We surrender! Please! We...~p~Oh, hey, everyone! Look! It's ~player_creature_name~! What a relief! We thought maybe we were possibly under attack, so we thought it best to capitulate pre-emptively.~p~It's okay, everyone! Looks like we're not being enslaved after all. Carry on.
0x00000038 Oh dear, ~player_creature_name~.~p~You'll have to forgive us. Last week, all of ~race_homeworld~ came down with hysterical pregnancies. So, we've been busy sorting out that mess...
0x000002A4 ~player_title~ is rivaled in appearance only by the sun in splendor! Welcome! We regret that our emporium cannot equal your glory, but we hope you take a look at it anyway.
0x000002A5 Your appearance is glorious, marred only by the lack of accessories. Perhaps we could sell ~player_title~ some?
0x00000023 Ahh, my friend! I was wondering where that devilishly handsome galactic hero had gone off to. Have you lost weight? Are you working out? You look fabulous. Supple.~p~You should come by more often. The ~race_homeworld~oids make a great stir-fry. We'll have you over sometime! 
0x00000037 It's so lovely to see you again. It's a true delight for all of ~race_homeworld~ to deal with someone of your poise and station! You honor us with your presence... and those steely good looks! That's right - I'm comfortable enough with myself to say it! 
0x0000002E Greetings! Once again our eyes feast upon your magnificence. How can we make ~player_title~ happy?
0x000002A6 Greetings to our friend ~player_title~. Welcome in Spode's name.
0x000002A7 We hope the servants of Spode may help ~player_title~.
0x000002A8 Is ~player_title~ ready to hear the Word of Spode?
0x0000002F I greet you in Spode's name.
0x000002A9 Welcome, friend ~player_title~. Let us reason together.
0x000002AA How may the ~race~ aid its friend ~player_title~?
0x000002AB We are met in the light of knowledge. Speak freely, ~player_title~.
0x00000030 Let us reason together.
0x000002AC We see that ~player_title~ prospers, like a vine wrapped around a strong tree. The ~race~ are the tree. You are the vine.
0x000002AD We welcome the honorable ~player_title~ to our security zone. 
0x000002AE ~player_title~ has dealt with the ~race~ in honor. Therefore we honor you with our welcome.
0x0000003A Hmmm, what? I seem to recall you dimly. I know you're no threat, but that's about the nicest thing I have to say about you. Was there something you wanted? We probably won't help, but it don't cost nothin' to ask...
0x00000031 The light of your species is not yet extinguished, we see.
0x000002AF ~player_title~ may now attempt to justify your continued existence.
0x00000025 Bzzzzzt. Object identified: ~player_creature_name~. This entity is already known to The Grox. Designation: Banal. Thank you for visiting. End.
0x00000032 You may now attempt to justify your continued existence.
0x00000033 The Grand Council views ~player_title~'s arrival with interest.
0x000002B0 Please state the reason for ~player_title~'s visit to the ~race~.
0x000002B1 The Grand Council wishes to know ~player_title~'s purpose here.
0x00000034 Hello, ~player_title~, may we rectify your spirits?
0x000002B2 ~player_title~ has interrupted our aromatherapy session. But now that you're here, I suppose we can talk.
0x000002B3 We are all made of star-stuff. Even ~player_title~. 
0x000002B4 We think we've seen ~player_title~ before. Or maybe it was someone else equally bland.
0x000002B5 Hello! We hope that ~player_title~ will amuse us today.
0x00000035 ~player_title~ is an odd creature, but oddly endearing. Maybe this visit will be fun.
0x00000036 Greetings. The servants of Spode wonder what has brought ~player_title~ here.
0x000002B6 Hello. Spode requires that we offer hospitality even to unbelievers.
0x000002B7 Spode is the source of all hope. ~player_title~ would do well to listen to the Word of Spode. 
0x0000003C Hello. The ~race~ recognize ~player_title~. 
0x000002B8 Greetings. We hope ~player_title~ will be brief.
0x000002B9 We hope this discussion with ~player_title~ will help to serve nature.
0x0000003D We hope your splendor comes prepared to boost our economy.
0x000002BA The ~race~'s bazaar is closed for the moment, but we suppose we could open it if ~player_title~ promised to buy something.
0x000002BB Our delight in your presence is matched only by our hopes that ~player_title~ will visit our boutique.
0x0000003E The light of your species is not yet extinguished, we see.
0x000002BC ~player_title~ has come again to our security zone. We will restrain our curiosity concerning the reason.
0x000002BD ~player_title~ has returned. We assume you require our aid.
0x00000026 Ehhh? Who's there? No solicitors!~p~Oh. You again. The ~race~ doesn't like you.~p~Course, we don't like no one. At least we know you, so I guess you're ahead of the game there. Well? What do you want?
0x0000003F We hope ~player_title~ is capable of intelligent conversation.
0x000002BE The ~race~ stand for reason and the advancement of knowledge. Does ~player_title~ stand for anything in particular?
0x000002BF We are having a hard time fitting ~player_title~ into our taxonomy. Do you happen to know your phylum?
0x000002C0 Make your case.
0x0000003B Phzzzzzp. Scanning...~p~Scanning...~p~Entity identified: ~player_creature_name~~p~Threat Status: Low.~p~Likes/Dislikes: IRRELEVANT! IRRELEVANT!
0x00000029 Grox says 'Hello'... again.
0x00000040 Has ~player_title~ come to a realization of the terrible consequences of your actions?
0x000002C1 The ~race~ stand fast against the aggression of ~player_title~. Talk quickly.
0x000002C2 The Grand Council views ~player_title~ with suspicion. What do you want here?
0x00000041 It takes generations of bad karma to produce someone like ~player_title~. 
0x000002C3 If you intend to impose a materialist lifestyle on us, you're sadly mistaken.
0x000002C4 There is a special abyss in the afterlife reserved for those such as ~player_title~.
0x00000042 It's the boring old ~player_title~! Who let ~player_title~ in?
0x000002C5 Is it the ~player_title~, or has the headache come back?
0x000002C6 Here you are... just in time for us to appoint you the honorary subject in our Festival of Humiliations! Stick around and we'll send you some ripe garbage to get started.
0x00000021 Hey, it's our old nemesis, ~player_creature_name~! I was just thinking about your rotten carcass, and now here you are. Perhaps I am evolving psychic abilities. Let me see if I know what you're thinking now...~p~Hey, that's rude! You're a jerk!
0x000002C7 Beware, lest Spode unleash his wrath.
0x00000043 ~player_title~ comes from outer darkness to seek the Light of Spode?
0x000002C8 The servants of Spode are busy. Be quick.
0x00000044 ~player_title~, make this quick.
0x000002C9 Kindly provide a justification for ~player_title~'s presence.
0x000002CA Is ~player_title~ here to learn proper behavior?
0x00000045 We hope that ~player_title~ is prepared to spend lots of money.
0x000002CB We are willing to trade even with the likes of ~player_title~.
0x000002CC You honor us with your presence. Now that we've been honored, will ~player_title~ go away?
0x00000046 The flame of your species flutters in the wind, and may soon die.
0x000002CD We stand ready to crush ~player_title~ as if you were a meddlesome insect. Perhaps you have a reason why this should not occur?
0x000002CE Has ~player_title~ come to beg our aid?
0x00000047 Can ~player_title~ give us a reason not to dissect you immediately?
0x000002CF We are reasoning beings. ~player_title~, however, we're not sure about.
0x000002D0 Your species is a perfect argument against intelligent design.
0x000002D1 ~player_title~ has made a fatal error.
0x00000048 The Grand Council graciously considers ~player_title~'s petition for capitulation. 
0x000002D2 In order to explore all possible avenues for peace and security, the Grand Council gives ~player_title~ license to address us.
0x00000049 Your vibrations are disharmonious. Speak quickly!
0x000002D3 Has ~player_title~ come to surrender?
0x0000004A Your violence is both useless and tedious in the extreme. And to think we once thought ~player_title~ was cute! 
0x000002D4 If ~player_title~ surrenders, we could all have a big party!
0x000002D5 ~player_title~ wars against Spode himself! Accept Spode or die!
0x0000004B ~player_title~'s extinction will serve Spode's Holy Plan!
0x000002D6 The Warriors of Spode will hold their fire for only a short time. Be brief.
0x0000004C We are at war. Be thankful ~player_title~ still lives, and state your business.
0x000002D7 Has ~player_title~ reconsidered your policy of viciousness and aggression?
0x0000004D We're at war! The boutique is closed!
0x000002D8 No matter how much ~player_title~ begs, we won't sell you things until you surrender!
0x000002D9 We are a peaceful people, but when aroused we are fierce!
0x0000004E Your pleas for mercy are unlikely to be answered.
0x000002DA An abject surrender may prove your best option.
0x000002DB When the beasts of war are unleashed, it is nearly impossible to recall them.
0x00000028 Puny, ~player_creature_name~! You and your people shall soon know what it is to live your lives under the jackboots of the mighty ~race~! All you know shall be as dust! We will destroy you all!
0x0000004F We'd like to see your head in a jar of formaldehyde!
0x000002DC Get out the dissecting knives! The guest of honor has arrived!
0x000002DD Let's just shoot first and reason afterward.
0x00000006 The Grox will exterminate you. 
0x0000006E Greetings ~race~. A pleasure to see you.
0x0000006F Greetings. Nice to see you.
0x00000070 Starship ~ufo_name~ requesting permission to orbit.
0x00000071 Salutations! There is something I'd like to discuss...
0x00000072 Thank you for receiving me. 
0x00000075 I forgot what I was gonna say.
0x00000076 I think we're done here. Bye.
0x00000077 Oops, sorry. Wrong alien.
0x00000078 Never mind. I have to go.
0x00000073 Oops. Wrong number.
0x00000074 Bigfatstupidaliensayswhat?
0x00000169 We humbly thank you for sharing your technology with us and advancing our society. We hope our empires can share this galaxy in peace. 
0x0000016A Who would have thought leaving the holiday lights on a month too long would lead to this.~p~Thanks for advancing our primitive society.
0x0000016B Thank you for helping us transcend to the next level of physical and spiritual being. 
0x0000016C We sense much good in you. Good luck in your travels and we hope that our Empires can live as one within the galaxy. 
0x0000016D Our race thanks you for your kindness. We can now market our goods galaxy wide. 
0x0000016E Praise Spode! Time to start spreading the word across the galaxy.
0x0000016F It was only logical that at some point our race would evolve into a space faring empire. We thank you for your contribution. 
0x00000170 We hold much respect for you for your actions.~p~We have much work to do. Building a large fleet to secure our place in the galaxy doesn't happen over night. 
0x00000171 These actions do not compute. 
0x00000551 On behalf of the Galactic Community, I welcome you to Space.
0x00000656 Eeghad! The galaxy appears to be a dangerous place.~p~Try to take care of this ship, they're not cheap. 
0x00000172 Hey Captain! Did you make a wrong turn and find yourself in a bad part of the galaxy?~p~Enjoy the new ship smell. 
0x00000173 Gadzooks! You really took a beating out there.~p~The Empire acknowledges your bravery. 
0x00000657 Bring it! I'm ready for more.
0x00000174 Ouch! The Grox appear to be as strong and dangerous as rumored.~p~Be careful out there, Captain.
0x00000175 Jeepers! The Grox appear to show no mercy, Captain.~p~We commend your heroism. 
0x00000176 Good Googly Moogly! These Grox are tough.~p~Captain, your bravery does not go unnoticed here. 
0x00000659 Bring it! I'm ready for more.
0x0000065B You met the Grox? And you're alive to tell the story.~p~All ~player_creature_name~ will sing your praise.~p~We'll need to destroy the Grox, if we're ever to find out the secrets that lie at the center of the galaxy. 
0x00000107 You've visited the Grox? That means they must be close.~p~We must alert the Galactic Council at once.~p~They must be protecting something at the center of the galaxy.
0x000001AC Good Groxily moxily, you met the Grox and are still in one piece.~p~Don't bring any of your robotic freak friends to any of our planets.~p~I hope they just stay at the center of the galaxy where they belong.
0x000001AD An encounter with the Grox cannot be good for one's spirit.~p~You should sit in the Pools of Cleansing to rid yourself of such negative energy.~p~Ah, the secrets they must hold about the center of the galaxy.
0x000001AE Some friends told us you visited the Grox on one of their colonies. Is that for real?~p~That's like totally insane and far out at the same time.~p~We encountered them once on a trip to the center of the galaxy. They're not natural. 
0x000001AF Now you've done it. You visited a Grox occupied planet and then came here?~p~We'll need to close our shops early. There is sure to be trouble coming.~p~Traveling that close to the center of the galaxy is dangerous.
0x000001B0 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, our data recorders show you've encountered the Grox.~p~We too have been studying them and the mysteries that surround the center of the galaxy.~p~Good luck with your research. 
0x000001B5 We ~race~ are honored to be in the presence of one so great.~p~It is said that ~player_creature_name~ has visited Grox worlds and is fearless.~p~To really prove one's courage, ~player_creature_name~ should try visiting the center of the galaxy.
0x000001B6 Spode has prophesized that one day a great hero will emerge to vanquish the Grox.~p~~player_creature_name~ may very well be that hero, after your encounter with the Grox.~p~The prophecy ends at the center of the galaxy.
0x000001B7 STATUS REPORT: Contact made.
0x0000065D Hmmm, maybe I will go to the center of the galaxy.
0x000001B8 Thanks for showing up. Without you, this would have been a real nightmare. We really appreciate your help!
0x000001B9 Thanks for the help! You really saved the day back there. It would have been terrible without you.
0x000001BA Wow, you're a true hero! We don't know what we would have done if you hadn't shown up. Thank you!
0x000001BB Thank you. We will immediately submit an Expedited Motion for Grateful Acknowledgement. The paperwork should come through within two Galactic Standard Years.
0x000001BC We humbly appreciate your assistance. Your efforts here will be recorded in the Official Registry of Good Deeds and Positive Actions.
0x000001BD Thank you for your assistance. Without your help, we might not have completed our Vote of Preparation For Planning to Take Immediate Action.
0x000001BE Joyous day! We're clever, but not clever enough to guess what might have happened without your help! You have our thanks.
0x000001BF We're safe, we're saved! Should someone get credit? Maybe, yes, no... Of course someone should, it's you! Thank you so much!
0x000001C0 Hooray for the ~player_species~! We'll sing a song of thanks in your name, and we'll do it every day, until we forget!
0x000001C1 Thank you, friend. A being who helps in times of need is a blessing to his allies, and shall be blessed in return.
0x000001C2 Your actions speak louder than any words for the honor of your species, friend. We thank you from the bottoms of our hearts.
0x000001C3 There is no greater virtue in the universe than the willingness to help another being. We are honored to know the ~player_species~ and offer our most humble thanks.
0x000001C4 Wow, that could have been nasty. But you totally rocked this place! Thanks... thanks for everything.
0x000001C5 That could have been ugly! Looks like you saved the day, you know? You're a real hero to our people.
0x000001C6 That was... You were... It was... Wow. You really made the difference. You have our thanks!
0x000001C7 Thanks for the help! I bet we couldn't have done it without you. Keep in mind, I don't bet too often... We're market opportunists, not gamblers.
0x000001C8 Thanks for keeping us in business! You can't even begin to imagine how much profit we stood to lose without your intervention.
0x000001C9 Thanks for helping out! This kind of external assistance is exactly what helps us maintain our low, low insurance premiums.
0x000001CA ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, your assistance is greatly appreciated, and will be duly noted in our logs.
0x000001CB ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, you have been a great help today. Thank you for your efforts here.
0x000001CC ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, we owe you a debt of gratitude. Your efforts on our behalf will not be forgotten.
0x000001CD ~player_species~ has helped in a time of need. We thank you for this help.
0x000001CE ~player_species~ assists us. We are grateful. We thank ~player_species~.
0x000001CF ~player_species~ comes to aid the ~race~. We ~race~ thank you.
0x000001D0 The Will of Spode brings a ~player_creature_name~ to aid us in our time of need! Thanks be unto Spode, and also unto thee, noble ~player_creature_name~.
0x000001D1 A thousand appreciations of the ~race~ are thine, ~player_title~ of the ~player_species~, for assistance given here this day.
0x000001D2 The ~race~ offer many thanks to the ~player_species~. Thou shalt be remembered for rendering aid in a time of trouble.
0x000001D3 Appreciative response. The ~player_species~ has been of significant value. Giving of thanks is customary.
0x000001D4 STATUS REPORT: Situation under control with assistance from ~player_species~. Gratitude for assistance is appropriate.
0x000001D5 Assistance confirmed. This ~player_creature_name~ is thanked for its contributions. End of transmission.
0x000001D6 Anytime.
0x000001D7 You're very welcome.
0x000001D8 No trouble at all. 
0x000001D9 Hey, where were you? You had better not make a habit of disappearing when trouble shows up.
0x000001DA Thanks for nothing! You've got that fancy flying contraption, so how about you use it to help out every now and then?
0x000001DB Well, thanks for showing up... Too bad you came too late to do anything useful. Try to be a little more responsive in the future.
0x000001DC The situation has already been resolved without your help. In the future, should we call upon you for assistance, we would appreciate your promptness.
0x000001DD I'm sorry, but twelve of the thirteen Official Keepers of Subjective Time agree that you have arrived too late to be useful. Thank you for coming.
0x000001DE You're too late. We already deployed our Emergency Protocol for Times of Moderate to Severe Crisis. All that's left is paperwork, and we can handle that ourselves, thank you.
0x000001DF Oh, calamity, despair! You have arrived too late to be of any use. Perhaps in the future, as you sing and dance and cavort throughout the universe, you could also pay attention to the passage of time?
0x000001E0 Let us tell you a story... it involves the ~player_species~, and the ~race~, and our utter disappointment at the lack of timely assistance. You should be able to guess how the story goes.
0x000001E1 Hooray for the ~player_species~!' That's what we might have sung, had you shown up in time to do anything. It's far too late now, of course.
0x000001E2 It is over and finished. Thank you for your eventual arrival, friend, but there is nothing left to be done.
0x000001E3 We have handled the situation ourselves. We thank you for coming, but you are too late to be of assistance.
0x000001E4 It is too late, friend. Please do not apologize, a hand extended in time is worth a thousand apologies after the fact.
0x000001E5 Not to be harsh, but you need to be a little more... responsive, you know? You totally missed all the action.
0x000001E6 Nature can fend for itself, but it still likes the help, you know? Things could have gone better... if you had been here.
0x000001E7 Sorry, but you're way too late to help. It's all right. Life goes on. It would go on better, though, if you responded faster in the future.
0x000001E8 Thanks for showing up, but the losses are already on the books at this point. A ~player_creature_name~ like yourself must have lots of important things to do.
0x000001E9 Phew, that was a close one! You wouldn't believe how close it was. You might have seen how close it was, if you had shown up in time! Actually, it wouldn't have been close at all with your help. But it's too late to change that now. Too late, indeed.
0x000001EA It's too late to do anything now. Just between us, you should be glad that our lawyers aren't pressing you for damages due to tardiness.
0x000001EB ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, your failure to deliver timely assistance has endangered our research. We would appreciate promptness on future occasions.
0x000001EC ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, you are too late to be of assistance. Please try to arrive quickly if we should call upon you again for help.
0x000001ED ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, the situation has already been resolved. Your tardiness, regardless of intention, is not appreciated.
0x000001EE ~player_species~ is late. Too late. We ~race~ have dealt with the situation for now.
0x000001EF ~player_species~ comes to help, but the time for help is already over.
0x000001F0 ~player_species~ arrives too late to help us. Next time ~player_species~ must not be late.
0x000001F1 The ~player_species~ send aid, but they send it too late to be of use. Thine fault is tardiness, under the Judgement of Spode.
0x000001F2 We have handled the situation ourselves, a thousand thanks be to Spode. No thanks be to the ~player_species~ for their un-timeliness.
0x000001F3 The ~race~ emerge unscathed, all glory and thanks be to Spode. Shouldst thou wish to share in future glories, thou shalt be prompt in response.
0x000001F4 Dismissal. This ~player_creature_name~ did not arrive promptly. We have no need of aid at this time.
0x000001F5 STATUS REPORT: Situation is already under control. This ~player_creature_name~ was useless in this matter.
0x000001F6 The situation has been resolved. This ~player_creature_name~ was not present at the appropriate time.
0x000001F7 I'm sorry. Next time I'll be quicker to act.
0x000001F8 My apologies.
0x0000010F Woohoo! You started your journey as a greenhorn Captain and now you're a ~player_title~. ~p~This is truly a joyous time for all ~player_creature_name~.~p~Use your new powers wisely. 
0x00000058 The Grand Council asks you to use your newly-discovered powers in order to establish peace, security, and well-being throughout the galaxy.
0x000002DE Our friend ~player_title~ has completed a long quest for meaning.
0x000002DF We see that ~player_title~'s journey has reached a transcendent climax. The Grand Council is willing to advise, but we realize that our perspective is limited.
0x00000059 You're all super-awesome now! The galaxy is going to be more interesting with the likes of you around!
0x000002E0 Hello! Was the center of the galaxy fun? Should we build a resort there?~p~We see that you're all super-awesome now! The universe is going to be more interesting with the likes of you around!
0x000002E1 Wow, you've got all godlike and stuff. How little ~player_title~ has grown up!~p~Now that you've got all these nifty new abilities, we hope you'll use them in an amusing way.
0x000002E2 Welcome. Your waveform is godlike. Command, and we shall obey.
0x0000005A Greetings. You have made the Journey and achieved the Final Transcendence. How may we serve you?
0x0000005B Welcome. We see you have become the God That Has Come. We hope that you will use your powers in order to spread the seeds of abundant life throughout the galaxy.
0x000002E3 Your long journey has borne fruit! Welcome to the ~race~.~p~We are pleased to hope that your newfound powers may at last rid the galaxy of the Grox!
0x0000005C Your magnificence is unparalleled! The techniques and abilities you have brought with you from the galactic center are astounding!~p~I don't suppose any of them are for sale?
0x000002E4 We welcome our friend after the epic journey to the center of the galaxy! We always knew you had the potential to become a deity!~p~And in honor of your magnificence, we're putting special prices on everything in the bazaar!
0x000002E5 The source of your divine powers are of interest to us. Perhaps Spode has given them to you?
0x0000005D The followers of Spode cannot accept your divinity. But perhaps we can come to some other arrangement.
0x0000005E The objective evidence suggests that you have acquired godlike powers.~p~We hope you will use these powers in a peaceful search for meaning and objective truth.
0x000002E6 Our scans show that you have acquired astounding abilities. Let us come to a reasonable agreement on how best to deploy your new talents.
0x000002E7 You have returned from an epic journey with astounding new abilities.~p~Take care that your newfound powers do not cause you to overreach. Though we wish you no harm, we are willing and able to defend ourselves.
0x000002E8 The abilities you acquired as a consequence of your journey are astounding. They give you vast power.~p~Therefore, we are willing to treat you as equals.
0x00000060 We see that you have become what machines may not.~p~If you attempt to extinguish us, we will resist.
0x000002E9 The Grand Council will resist if you use your newfound powers to establish dominion.
0x000002EA ~player_title~ may have new toys, but you're still the same boring old you.
0x000002EB Your vibrations are uniformly hostile. Stay away!
0x000002EC Despite the increase in your powers, the ~race~ will still fight to protect the Universal Life Web!
0x000002ED Despite your great powers, we still won't sell you anything unless you pay for it.
0x000002EE You have committed the final blasphemy by transforming yourself into the God That Will Come! Beware the wrath of Spode!
0x000002EF If you use these new powers to bring about a dark age, we will resist you!
0x000002F0 If you attack us, we will resist to the utmost!
0x00000110 Do you think your new powers are any match for The Grox? Prepare for termination. 
0x00000534 Greetings ~race~. A pleasure to see you.
0x00000535 Greetings. Nice to see you.
0x00000536 Starship ~ufo_name~ requesting permission to orbit.
0x00000537 Salutations! There is something I'd like to discuss...
0x00000538 Thank you for receiving me. 
0x0000053B I forgot what I was gonna say.
0x0000053C I think we're done here. Bye.
0x0000053D Oops, sorry. Wrong alien.
0x0000007B Never mind. I have to go.
0x0000053E Oops. Wrong number.
0x00000540 Perhaps some money could end this war.
0x0000053F I'll see you on the galactic battlefield!
0x0000007C Bigfatstupidaliensayswhat?
0x00000111 The Grand Council hopes for a constructive dialog. 
0x00000112 We hope that a state of peace will always exist between our species. 
0x00000114 And as for us, we're not humble at all!
0x00000115 ...and you have so much to be humble about! Just kidding. Really.
0x00000117 All beings of true spiritual worth wish for nothing more than peace, harmony, and a distant chorus of angel voices.
0x00000180 Humility is the largest lily pad on the pond of wisdom!
0x00000182 We are all humble before the magnificent instrument that is Nature.
0x00000183 May all your worlds be fruitful! 
0x00000185 If you're peaceful, we won't sell you weapons unless you insist!
0x00000186 Beings of your magnificence are surely prepared to spend magnificently!
0x00000188 We hope for a productive exchange of information.
0x00000189 Let us reason together.
0x0000018B It is well that you approach us with humility, stranger.
0x0000018C As long as you retain your humility, we will have little to quarrel about.
0x00000513 Humility is the first step to becoming a follower of Spode!
0x00000514 The only true peace is the peace that Spode gives to his believers.
0x00000516 You will remain peaceful until we order you to war with our enemies.
0x00000008 It is well that you recognize our superiority.
0x0000008B It is an honor.
0x00000517 Greatness is achieved only by service to a higher ideal than the self.
0x00000518 Boastfulness is a quality unsuited to a diplomat.
0x00000009 If you're so great, how come we never heard of you?
0x0000000A You may be great, but you're wandering lost in a town full of frowns!
0x0000000B Boastfulness is a characteristic of the spiritually unevolved.
0x0000000F Our clairvoyants knew you were going to say that.
0x00000022 That may be possible, but even so you are only an expression of the Universal Life Web.
0x00000056 Civilizations come and civilizations go, but Nature remains.
0x00000065 If you're so great and powerful, you'll want to spend lots of money in our emporium!
0x0000006B We agree that you're absolutely tremendous! Will you spend money now?
0x00000097 Does the data support that claim?
0x00000098 Who besides you says that you're so great?
0x00000099 Perhaps one day this greatness shall be tested.
0x000000AC We look forward to a demonstration of this so-called greatness.
0x000000B9 Any greatness you possess is but a mere reflection of the greatness of Spode.
0x00000113 You are animated dust. Only Spode is great. 
0x00000116 We have encountered many civilizations that claimed greatness, and we have crushed them all.
0x00000181 On the contrary, you are nothing
0x0000008D I'm not as small as you think. But let's continue...
0x00000519 The Grand Council has every right to protect its citizens.
0x0000051A You have not yet achieved a status sufficient to give us orders.
0x00000184 ~player_title~ seems a little petulant today, don't you think?
0x00000187 Our weapons are tracking your every move, but only because we like you!
0x0000018A Why the belligerent aura, pilgrim?
0x0000018D Chant with us, and be prepared to turn that frown upside-down!
0x00000652 We act as we see fit within our own territory.
0x00000515 We do not recall inviting you here.
0x00000653 Just buy some stuff and leave, will you?
0x00000654 Any unpleasantness from you, and we'll close the emporium!
0x00000552 It is illogical to expect us to obey your orders.
0x00000553 Your pointless aggression is the sign of an inferior intelligence.
0x00000554 If you wish a test of skills, let it begin now.
0x00000555 It is a poor guest who threatens his host.
0x00000556 We stand alert to guard Spode's People from unbelievers.
0x00000557 Speak more respectfully before the followers of Spode!
0x00000558 Your threats mean nothing. 
0x00000559 If you wish to commit suicide, we will be happy to assist.
0x0000008F I sense some tension here. But let's continue...
0x0000007D Yes, Captain? How may we assist you?
0x0000007E Yes, Captain. What can we do for you?
0x0000007F Yes, Captain. How may we help?
0x00000080 Now that all things are in order, please state your business.
0x00000081 The Grand Council is ready to receive your request..
0x00000082 Wait, wait. Let us guess what you want...!~p~Hmmmmm... is it... an umbrella??!~p~Okay, no... you go ahead and tell us.
0x00000083 Do you want some cake? We have some cake?~p~Oh, wait... We don't have any cake.~p~Hmmm...~p~Hey, are you selling any cake?
0x00000084 Noble ~player_creature_name~. What would you request of us this day?
0x00000085 Noble ~player_creature_name~. Speak to us of your request.
0x00000086 Noble ~player_creature_name~. Would you tell us what you desire?
0x00000087 Peace and light. What is your wish?
0x00000088 Take your time... enjoy the waves of the galactic flow...~p~When you are ready... tell us what you need.
0x00000089 Yes, yes! Happy to help, happy to help. What can we do for you?
0x00000090 Please tell us how we can make your visit more comfortable.~p~We are more than happy to assist you any way we can.
0x00000091 What is the business that you have with us?
0x00000092 Speak of what thou doest desire and the followers of Spode will listen.
0x00000093 For it is written in the Scrolls of Faith, 'Reject ye not the traveler, until you know their purpose.'~p~What is your purpose?
0x00000094 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. It is only reasonable to argue that if you don't tell us what you want, we won't be able to help you.
0x00000095 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. State your purpose of visit.
0x00000096 What do you want? Be quick and do not waste our time.
0x0000009A Speak then. What do you want.
0x000002F1 We await your briefing.
0x000002F2 Fzbzzork.~p~Input purpose of visit.
0x000002F3 Tell us your business.
0x000002F4 Speak.
0x0000055C Your performing a mission on behalf of the Grand Council will be a step toward establishing interstellar amity between our peoples.
0x0000009B The Grand Council in intrigued by the possibility of your aiding us.
0x0000055D Let us discuss this matter in more detail.
0x0000055E You're offering to help us? That's an interesting idea.
0x0000055F We can often use help in our quest to expand the Universal Life Web. Let's discuss matters.
0x00000560 Let's explore the possibilities for cooperation.
0x00000561 You want to work for us? Wow, space-buddy, that's swell!
0x00000562 You want to do the toting and hauling while we sit in the shade and eat bonbons? Let's talk!
0x00000563 We'd love to put you to work! Let's discuss options!
0x00000564 We're pleased that you're willing to work for Spode's Holy Cause!
0x00000565 If you are willing to advance Spode's Work, we should discuss the matter.
0x00000566 A desire to work alongside Spode's Children is the beginning of wisdom. Let us consider this matter further.
0x00000567 We are willing to provide fair exchange for any work performed... assuming work is available, of course.
0x00000568 Our analyses show that outside contractors would be appropriate for certain projects. Let's consider the matter.
0x00000569 If a task is available, and you are willing, it is only logical to employ you.
0x0000056A You want to help us out? I suppose this means you want to get paid?
0x0000056B We offer fabulous rewards to anyone interested in helping us! If you'll fill out an application, we'll see if a job is available!
0x0000056C You want to work for us? We offer rewards equivalent to many important professions, such as dockworker and dishwasher!
0x0000056D Our karmas may be linked! Let's talk!
0x0000056E Your willingness to act on our behalf may be the beginning of the Process of Oneness! Let us examine the paths you may wish to tread.
0x0000056F Humility and generosity are the hallmarks of a illustrious spirit!
0x00000570 It is possible that we may offer you tasks that are unsuited to true warriors such as ourselves. 
0x00000571 It is well that you attempt to please us.
0x00000572 Your labors on our behalf will free us to better train for warfare.
0x00000573 It is possible that you may be of service.
0x00000574 Being useful to The Grox is the best guarantee of survival.
0x00000575 Rest assured that we will make use of you... eventually...
0x00000576 Let's see if Mission Control has any missions worthy of your time Captain.
0x00000577 Ready for work Captain? Let's see if we have anything for you.
0x00000578 Looking for an assignment? Let's see what we have. 
0x000001F9 Your Colony of ~planet_name~ is always greatful for any assistance. Let's see what we have. 
0x000001FA Ready to give ~planet_name~ Colony a helping hand Captain? Let's see what we have.
0x000001FB The Colony of the planet ~planet_name~ can always use your help Captain. Let's see if we have any missions that might interest you.
0x0000009C I'd like to learn more. Do you have any suggestions?
0x0000009D Is there anything that needs doing?
0x0000009E I'm looking for a quest? Anyone got a quest? I need a quest.
0x0000009F I yearn to feel the solar wind at my back. Any missions?
0x000000A0 I'm pretty handy, you know. You need a hand with anything?
0x000000AD Teach me your ways so I can become like you.
0x000000B7 I'm training with someone else... but I think I'd rather be like you. 
0x000000A1 I have some questions about my missions...
0x000000A2 I'd like to discuss missions in general...
0x000000A3 I'd like some clarification on missions.
0x000000A4 I'd like to talk about my missions.
0x00000579 Oh dear. Galactic Operating Procedures simply do not allow training in two Philosophies at once, think of the chaos the would cause! No! Do not think of it... it's too stressful!~p~If you wish to dedicate yourself to the Philosophy of Order, you must cancel your other obligation first.
0x0000057B Although we are all part of one universe, you can't learn about the Philosophy of Life and train with someone else at the same time, man.~p~Give them the bad news... or just drop out... and then you can train with us.
0x0000057D If you are to train in the Philosophy of Chance instead, you will need to cancel your other commitment first
0x0000057E If you are to train in the Philosophy of Chance instead, you will need to cancel your other commitment first
0x0000057F If you are to train in the Philosophy of Faith instead, you will need to cancel your other commitment first
0x00000580 If you are to train in the Philosophy of Faith instead, you will need to cancel your other commitment first
0x00000581 Well, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, The Philosophy of Science requires absolute dedication. If you wish to study with us, you must first terminate your other studies.
0x00000584 Great! Great! There's just one minor formality, a tiny little detail to work out.~p~Our standard contract for training in the Philosophy of Prosperity contains an exclusivity clause. You're gonna have to cancel any other training before we can make this deal happen.
0x00000585 If you are to train in the Philosophy of Harmony instead, you will need to cancel your other commitment first
0x00000586 If you are to train in the Philosophy of Harmony instead, you will need to cancel your other commitment first
0x00000587 To follow the Philosophy of Force, ~player_species~ must show commitment. ~player_species~ must first cancel all other training. Do this and return.
0x000000C3 I understand. One more thing before I go...
0x000000BA I will do what it takes to prove my worth to you. Fare well.
0x000000A5 While the Grand Council is willing to listen to any suggestions, their patience is not unlimited.
0x000000C2 Please be brief. The Grand Council has a full agenda for today.
0x000000CA Talk fast. We have seedlings to plant.
0x000000CC We'll listen, but we can't guarantee any more than that.
0x000000CE What? Are you here again?
0x000000D0 Make it brief. Your babbling hurts our ears.
0x000000D2 Spode's business is pressing. Keep it short.
0x000000D5 We will listen even to unbelievers. At least for a while.
0x000000D7 We trust you will not treat us to the unhinged babblings of an inferior intelligence.
0x000000D9 We'll listen to you, but we advise you not to unpack your bags.
0x000000DB We'll listen, but we'd better get some profit out of it!
0x000000DC Talk away. We can always ignore you.
0x0000010B The puddle may speak, but will the ocean listen?
0x000003DA Make your report, and we will decide.
0x000003DB You may feel free to spout your unenlightened drivel. We shall feel free to ignore you.
0x000003DC Enlighten us, if you can.
0x000003DD The Grand Council welcomes the suggestions of its friend.
0x000003DE ~player_title~ is welcome to offer suggestions for an improvement in relations.
0x000003DF We welcome the suggestions of our friend from afar.
0x000003E0 We are pleased to see ~player_title~, and to hear your proposals.
0x000003E1 It's our space-buddy! How can we help you?
0x000003E2 Relax and we'll talk!
0x000003E3 We welcome you in the name of Spode. Can we be of assistance?
0x000003E4 We hope for an improvement in our relations. Let us ask Spode for a blessing.
0x000003E5 We are pleased to welcome our friend, and will listen to your counsel.
0x000003E6 We are pleased to add your input to our throughput. 
0x000003E7 How delightful that our magnificent friend has come to visit! What may we sell you?
0x000003E8 You are perfection itself! How may we serve you?
0x000003E9 We welcome ~player_title~ to our council.
0x000003EA Our comrade should feel free to state your case. 
0x000003EB We are pleased to participate in enlightened discourse. We are pleased to participate in enlightened discourse.
0x000003EC Your aura is a pleasing shade! How may we help you?
0x000003ED The Grand Council welcomes our gracious ally's suggestions. 
0x000003EE We are always delighted to hear from our ally.
0x000003EF Our friend and ally is welcome to speak to us.
0x000003F0 Your arrival was eagerly anticipated. Please let us know how we can help you.
0x000003F1 Our ally unites with us in advancing Spode's work! How may we help you?
0x000003F2 Spode blesses this meeting! Can we aid you in any way?
0x000003F3 We bask in the warmth of your conversation!
0x000003F4 You're always welcome to come here and entertain us!
0x000003F5 Please tell us how we may assist you.
0x000003F6 We welcome our ally, and seek your guidance.
0x000003F7 A visit from our glorious ally is always a cause for celebration! How may we help you?
0x000003F8 We welcome our honorable ally to the ~race~. May we help you?
0x000003F9 Our ally honors us with a visit. How may we be of service?
0x000003FA We welcome our honorable ally to the ~race~. May we help you?
0x000003FB Together, we bring illumination to the galaxy. How may we assist you?
0x000003FC Let us speak mind to mind, spirit to spirit.
0x000003FD The Grand Council is too busy to see you. You may speak into this little grill, and someone will eventually listen.
0x000003FE You presume to address us? We will not forbid you to speak.
0x000003FF Oh look! It's a teeny-tiny little emissary from a teeny-tiny little civilization! Does it have something to say?
0x00000400 Why should Spode's Holy Warriors permit a nonbeliever to address them?
0x00000401 Objective evidence suggests that our civilization is far more vast and powerful than yours. Be thankful we're listening, if only for a brief time.
0x00000402 Your civilization's purchasing power is practically nil compared with ours! Why should we market to someone as insignificant as you?
0x00000403 The superiority of our spiritual, enlightened civilization is plain. Speak quickly, before your primitive culture pollutes our minds.
0x00000404 A wrong word from you, and your civilization will be destroyed.
0x00000405 Speak. Be brief.
0x000000EB Speak, if you think you can aid our objectives.
0x00000323 Tell me about your philosophy...
0x00000324 I'd like to know about your race...
0x000000A6 Please accept our gift so we can be friends.
0x000000A7 Can you lend my fleet one of your ships?
0x000000A8 I'd like to establish a trade route with you.
0x000000A9 I'd like you to attack someone for me.
0x000000AA I'd like you to attack someone for me.
0x000000AB I'd like to purchase this star system.
0x00000668 I'd like to end our trade route.
0x000000AE An alliance would make both our empires mightier, yes?
0x000000AF Perhaps an alliance would benefit us both.
0x000000B0 Our people would prosper more from working together.
0x000000B1 I think we should form an alliance.
0x000000B2 You know that alliance of ours? Well... psych!
0x000000B3 We no longer choose to recognize our alliance. 
0x000000B4 This alliance is over. See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya!
0x000000B5 Our alliance is done! Smell ya later!
0x000000B6 This alliance is no longer beneficial for the people of ~player_homeworld~.
0x000000B8 I had something else to talk about.
0x00000406 The Grand Council views this suggestion favorably. Our ship will join you at once.
0x00000407 The Grand Council is pleased to be of assistance to our ally. Our ship is at your disposal.
0x00000408 Our ships are at your service friend. ~p~We will burn the ceremonial tree and dance the forbidden dance in celebration of this joyous occasion. 
0x00000409 Our alliance will be all the stronger once our ship joins yours.
0x0000040A There's nothing we'd love better than careening around the galaxy with our space-buddy! Our ship will join you as soon as we can stop dancing!
0x0000040B A floating party! Excellent suggestion! Our ship is on its way!
0x0000040C Spode's warriors will join you at once!
0x0000040D Our ships will fly the galaxy together, to advance Spode's holy cause!
0x0000040E It is reasonable to conclude that two ships are more formidable than one. We shall dispatch our ship at once.
0x0000040F If other species see that we are united, they will consider us more formidable. Our ship is on its way.
0x00000410 We'll send our ship at once. No pirates are going to attack us with our magnificent ally around!
0x00000411 We were thinking that very thing ourselves! Our ship will arrive shortly.
0x00000412 Together, we will be most formidable. We send our latest-model war craft to join you!
0x00000413 The ship will report to you shortly. Together, we will bring our enemies to their knees.
0x00000414 We will send our ship. If you do not treat it well, there will be consequences.
0x00000415 For reasons entirely our own, we grant your request.
0x00000177 We will send you the ship you requested and fly as one. 
0x00000178 Your request is granted. Our ship is on its way.
0x000002F5 Excellent. That's very helpful.
0x00000325 We, the ~race~, subscribe to the Philosophy of Order. Visit the Grand Council and you'll see our motto etched on its doors: Peace is the child of Order and Reason. We seek to bring all nations, races, and empires to Order.~p~We offer the Super-Technology of Static Cling. This neutralizes the messy turrets of hostile cities against our Space Ships and allies, whilst we reason with their leadership.
0x00000326 We, the ~race~ follow the Philosophy of Order. Our Councils keep the Harmony and update all the forms and Galactic Calendars. It's the way of measurable progress. Without Order, the garbage just piles up!~p~Speaking of which, we have Static Cling Super-Technology. We use this to halt the turrets of disorderly cities anywhere, so we can negotiate them into an alliance... And make sure the forms get filed on time, in triplicate.
0x00000289 We, the ~race~ subscribe to the practice of Order. When we are not forming alliances, our Grand Council is organizing the Sub-Councils. It all fits together so neatly!~p~We offer the Super-Technology of Static Cling to halt all terrestrial turret defenses. Turrets must be silenced to form an alliance! Ahem.
0x00000327 We, the ~race~ adhere to the Philosophy of Chance! It is not of our choice to follow strict rules. We follow our hearts, we're jolly as fools. But don't make us cross, or sour our mood, or before you know it, you'll be our next food.~p~Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us...
0x000001A4 We, the ~race~ follow the Philosophy of Chance! We don't march around aimlessly like an army of ants, nor do we all wear the same designer pants. Instead, we laugh and we sing and we all try to dance, while being very careful not to trample our plants.~p~Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us...
0x00000328 We, the ~race~ are followers of the Philosophy of Chance! Our looks may be deceiving, but we are not normally a violent and war-like species. We enjoy the finer things in life, like food and drink and laughter. Why, just last month we had some friends over for dinner from a neighboring system. They were delicious!~p~Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us...
0x00000526 Wise traveler. Learn all that you can, for there are many different true answers for life's questions. The beings of the ~race~ follow the Philosophy of Harmony. As such, we know that every species must find its own truth.~p~For the followers of Harmony, our touchstone is home. With our gift, we are able to teleport to our homeworld to reconnect with our terraself.
0x00000527 We, the ~race~, follow the Philosophy of Harmony. All beings can enter this Circle and harmonize with us.~p~This has given us the power of the Return Ticket. Once part of the Harmony, and from any place in the Universe, intone the Pure Syllable, and instantly one is transported back home.
0x0000066E We, the ~race~ are Philosophers of Harmony. Those who harmonize with us have found inner stillness where it begins: At home.~p~In addition to discovering our inner beauty, practicing Harmony grants the universal power of the Return Ticket. From all points in the Universe, those in Harmony can instantly teleport back home.
0x00000528 We, the ~race~ follow the Scrolls of Life.~p~We are the heavens, the celestial light, the stars! We are the soil, the water and the air... We believe in the harmony of the universe and everything in it. We are just part of a greater whole, we are fleeting! Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us...
0x00000529 We, the ~race~ follow the Scrolls of Life.~p~These Scrolls teach that it is incumbent upon us to preserve our natural world... To take nothing but memories from our surroundings and to plant ideas and reap peace! To sow magic, man. Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us...
0x00000664 Listen, dude, and we will tell you what's up. We, the ~race~ believe in the Scrolls of Life. We believe that you are us and that we are you and that together we are one! Man, we are one with plants and animals, stars in the heavens, clouds in the atmosphere! We even have a safari vacuum that we use to abduct plants and animals so that they can join us in the circle of life.
0x0000052A We, the ~race~ lay claim to the often-imitated, never-duplicated Philosophy of Prosperity. I'll have you know that it's merely the finest Philosophy in all the known Universe, the unknown Universe, and everything in between. The Philosophy of Prosperity teaches us the value of loyalty, honesty, happiness, and a well-written contract. After all, not even the Tablet of Prosperity can guarantee future performance based on past results.
0x0000052B Thanks to the Philosophy of Prosperity, we, the ~race~ love everything! We love our Empire, we love other Empires, we love happy people, we love unhappy people. But most of all we love our profit margins. And we love all the other things because they contribute to our margins!
0x0000066F  We, the ~race~ are a simple people, concerned with simple things. There's only one care we have in the world: following the Philosophy of Prosperity. A simpler Philosophy you will never find.~p~Just between you and me, the best parts are where the Tablet of Philosophy is talking about accounting methods. Of course there's also the chapter on calculating earnings potential. And who can forget those beautiful verses on the balance of trade, and the cost-benefit analysis of limited market segmentation. Maybe my favorite chapter is the analysis of the impact of solar-localized demand fluctuation on a pan-galactic Empire.~p~But yes, as someone of your observational prowess can clearly see, we ~race~ are a simple people with simple motives.
0x00000670 As members of the ~race~, we strongly believe in the Philosophy of Prosperity. It teaches us to mind our own business, and to mind it very well. There's no other Empire in the Universe that can compete with our levels of operational efficiency!~p~Although I must say, you look like a clever ~player_creature_name~, and I'll bet you're doing a heck of a job running your Empire, aren't you? Don't be modest, of course you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me!~p~Only the smartest species in the Universe know to seek out the ~race~ for all their financial advisory needs. And only the smartest species in the Universe sign up for our training courses on the Philosophy of Prosperity. We also offer group discounts if you know any other Empires who want to learn the secrets of the Tablet of Prosperity. Sorry, no refunds.
0x0000052C We, the ~race~ are followers of the teachings of Spode and the Philosophy of Faith! We heard about you before you arrived here and quite honestly We cannot believe that you do not believe in the beliefs that We believe in! Unbelievable! 
0x0000052D We, the ~race~ adhere to the truth: the Philosophy of Faith! It behooves you to believe as we believe, because both you and I know that we, the ~race~ are right in what we believe! All hail, followers of Spode!
0x00000665 We, the ~race~ follow the one, true Philosophy of Faith! Woe be to those who do not share our beliefs in the teachings of Spode, for they are wrong in the face of all that is right. If you were to repent now and admit your wrongness, we the ~race~ may take mercy upon you and help you to see the way of the Rightness!
0x0000052E We, the ~race~ follow the Scrolls of Science.~p~It is our duty to study, dissect and examine the universe around us. We seek knowledge and it is our fervent belief that every question can be answered with research, systematic categorization, dedication and logic. Knowledge is our fuel and there is no higher calling than learning. Those who try to prevent us from our scholarship do so at their peril.
0x00000666 Come, my student. Learn about we, the ~race~, who subscribe to the Philosophy of Science. It is our duty to scrutinize those around us and to evaluate scientifically that which is not immediately apparent. The only truth is Science, not religion, not universality. Cold, hard fact. That is our Spode.
0x0000052F We, the ~race~ follow the Scrolls of Science.~p~We believe that the survival of the species is based on managing risk! How do you evaluate risk? Through study, careful examination! We are not in the business of following our whims! We have the power to research all life and the power to destroy life on a planet with a single Gravitation Wave, such is our super power.
0x00000530 The ~race~ are strong and powerful. The Philosophy of Force is the only choice. All other philosophies are weak! ~p~Those that are strong enough to follow the Philosophy of Force will have the added power to call in a fighting force to attack their enemies.
0x00000531 ~player_creature_name~ want to know what makes ~race~ into ~race~.~p~It is the Philosophy of Force! How has ~race~ survived? Always, others want to fight. Always, others want to take away! It is Force that helps ~race~ against the others. When they fight, we fight back, we fight better. We stand together until the fight is won. That is ~race~! That is the philosophy of Force.~p~When you know Force, you know that one is strong, but many are stronger.~p~Force will bring you help in your fights.
0x0000066B ~player_creature_name~ ask about ~race~? ~player_creature_name~ ask about Force.~p~Force is like rock. Many storms pass over rock, but rock does not move. Rock is hard, rock is strong. Rock does not break. Other things break under rock! Rock crushes all.~p~We ~race~ are a field of rock. Always strong, and never one rock alone. If the enemy comes, we fight them together and do not break. If the enemy does not come, we bring our rock to the enemy... and crush them! That is the way of Force.
0x0000066C Ha! ~player_creature_name~ ask questions about ~race~. ~player_creature_name~ is nervous. ~player_creature_name~ is afraid. Afraid of the ~race~! Good. All species should fear the ~race~.~p~We follow the Philosophy of Force. We are strong and mighty, and our numbers are great. Force keeps us strong and brings us victory on the battlefield.~p~Tell me, who has more power than ~race~? Sometimes, others think that they are stronger. Each time, they are wrong. There is only one species that we cannot defeat, but you are not them.
0x0000066D We ~race~ know the Philosophy of Force. It is strength, and it is victory.~p~First, we were strongest among our neighbors. Then we were strongest in all our lands. Then we found new lands and new neighbors. We went there in great numbers, and we fought, and we were strongest there, too. And now we are the strongest of all empires... all empires but one.~p~If anyone dares challenge the ~race~, then we will fight. And we will win.
0x0000011E What foolish mortal deigns to seek countenance with the all powerful and most extraordinary Grox? How dare you disgrace us with your meager and lackluster presence? We care not to breathe the self same air that you have poisoned with your noxious aura.~p~After I spend some time berating you, the expectation will be that you begin your exodus out of our system post haste. I feel the need to cleanse my very eyeball after having soiled my retina with the ghastly vision that is your form. Be gone oh foul and unsightly trespasser!~p~Don't let the gravitational pull of our planet hit you in the backside on your way out!
0x00000532 That's fascinating! Thank you for sharing.
0x00000533 That's all I need to know. So long.
0x000000C4 The Grand Council is pleased to aid our ally. What is the target?
0x00000416 Which objective did our ally have in mind?
0x00000417 Our fleet stands prepared. Where did you wish it to go?
0x00000418 Do we have a mutual enemy? If so, who?
0x00000419 Right! Let there be explosions, flying debris, and slaughter! Let's blow 'em up! Let's devastate their worlds! Let's get medieval on 'em!~p~Ummm... who are we supposed to be attacking, exactly?
0x0000041A We're ready to smash in their mealy little faces, if only you'll tell us where we're going and who we're hitting.
0x0000041B Spode's warriors await your call! Where is our target?
0x0000041C Let Spode's legions unleash the weapons of galactic devastation! Where are we going?
0x0000041D In order to best apply military force, you would have to inform us of the location of the target.
0x0000041E We stand ready to crush our mutual enemies, but you will have to tell us where.
0x0000041F We are prepared to steal whole worlds from the bad guys, but you'll have to tell us which bad guys!
0x00000420 Our glorious ally has only to tell us where to strike, and we will obey!
0x00000421 We are prepared to fight by your side, but even our most able telepaths haven't been able to tell us the target.
0x00000422 Barring a few hours of chanting and burning incense, our ships are ready. It's time to declassify the target.
0x00000423 We are pleased to aid our honorable ally, if you would give us a briefing on the objective.
0x00000424 The fleet stands ready, ~player_title~! Where is it going?
0x00000425 We are pleased to aid in the extermination of organic life-forms. Please inform us as to the nature of the target.
0x00000426 Where do you wish us to strike?
0x000000C5 ~empire_name_1~ at ~star_name_1~
0x000000C6 ~empire_name_2~ at ~star_name_2~
0x000000C7 ~empire_name_3~ at ~star_name_3~
0x000000C8 ~empire_name_4~ at ~star_name_4~
0x000000C9 On second thought, I'd rather not.
0x00000427 We regret to report that we are facing a crisis of our own. The Grand Council would be grateful for your help.
0x00000428 Unfortunately we are facing an emergency at the moment. Any help you can give us would be welcome. 
0x00000429 We'd love to help you incinerate your foes, but alas, things have gone seriously awry here at the moment. Feel free to help us clean up!
0x0000042A We would love to help you deal with Spode's enemies, but we are facing challenges of our own right now. Perhaps you would care to aid Spode's cause...?
0x0000042B An analysis of the current situation reveals that we cannot conduct warfare and cope with our own crisis at the same time. Your aid in helping us manage the latter is solicited.
0x0000042C We would love fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with beings as awesome as yourselves, but we're facing an emergency situation of our own right now! Can you aid us?
0x0000042D We would like to kick some spiritually unevolved beings around the galaxy, but we've just become aware of an emergency here in our own civilization. You would gain many good karma points if you'd help us!
0x0000042E It is a principle of warfare never to fight on two fronts. A new front has opened within our own realm. Perhaps our ally can help...?
0x0000042F No. Stand by for further orders.
0x000002F6 I understand. One more thing before I go...
0x000000CB Okay. Thanks for letting me know.
0x000002F7 goodbye
0x00000430 The Grand Council is pleased to report that this target is already under assault.
0x00000431 Our fleet is already attacking that world.
0x00000432 Wow! It's like our minds are totally in synch! Our own Paisley Task Force is already assaulting that target!
0x00000433 Spode's Holy Warriors have attacked that world already, and soon will claim the target for the forces of righteousness!
0x00000434 Our strategists have confirm your analysis of the tactical situation, and issued their recommendations some time ago. Our fleet is already on the attack in that quadrant.
0x00000435 We have anticipated your magnificent strategic thought! Our forces are already on the attack!
0x00000436 Before you arrived, Guru P'tang sensed your intentions through the luminiferous aether, and our ships are already attacking that target!
0x00000437 Our ships have already been sent to crush that planet.
0x00000438 You do not need to tell us what to do. Our ships already struck that world.
0x000000CD Okay. Good to know that.
0x00000439 Our scouts have reported to the Grand Council that the target is already under attack.
0x0000043A Our sensors indicate that life-forms are under threat in that system. An attack is in progress! 
0x0000043B Someone anticipated you, star-buddy! That system is already being trashed!
0x0000043C One of our scouts, freshly martyred, has informed us that the system is already under attack.
0x0000043D Analysis of spectra strongly suggests that this system is already being attacked.
0x0000043E We've encountered refugees who have informed us that this system is already under assault!
0x0000043F Our revered Seer Qrooorlo went into a trance and told us that an attack was already in progress.
0x00000440 Scout vessels report that the system is already being attacked.
0x00000441 You are too late. The system is already under assault.
0x000000CF Okay. Thanks for the information.
0x00000442 The Grand Council regrets to report that this target is beyond the range of our fleet.
0x00000443 That would be sending our ships too far from home.
0x00000444 You want us to go all that enormous distance, just to fight a battle? No way!
0x00000445 Zeal in the service of Spode is not enough to send our ships all that way.
0x00000446 Unfortunately, you ask the impossible. Our fleet does not have sufficient range.
0x00000447 We would be delighted to help your excellence, but that target is beyond our range.
0x00000448 Even with our Extra-Power Magic Space Crystals, our ships can't travel that far!
0x00000449 We would be delighted to oblige our honorable ally, but our fleet lacks sufficient range.
0x0000044A It would weaken our blockade to send our forces that distance.
0x000000D1 Thanks anyway.
0x0000044B Unfortunately, the Grand Council is all too aware of the financial burden this attack would impose on our citizens. Can you aid us with a grant of ~attack_cost~?
0x0000044C A temporary fiscal shortfall makes it impossible to fully outfit our fleet. ~attack_cost~ would be required.
0x0000044D Outfitting the fleet with bio-compatible weapons has left us without the money to fight the actual battle. Could you possibly donate ~attack_cost~?
0x0000044E Maintaining a Green lifestyle in our war fleet is more expensive than we anticipated. Could you possibly help us to the extent of ~attack_cost~?
0x0000044F We're totally behind you in blowing the enemy to smithereens, but the last several festivals have left us stony broke! Could you possibly give us ~attack_cost~ for party supplies for the troops?
0x00000450 We're ready for the attack, but first we need to build the fleet's morale with a huge party! It will cost ~attack_cost~.
0x00000451 The necessity of outfitting the fleet with a large contingent of missionaries and many copies of the complete works of Spode has exhausted our treasury. Could you possibly contribute ~attack_cost~ to Spode's Holy Cause?
0x00000452 The spirit is willing, but the exchequer is weak! Could you possibly donate ~attack_cost~ to our cause?
0x00000453 Our economic analysis of the attack seems to have slipped a few integers. Could you possibly donate ~attack_cost~?
0x00000454 Unforeseen costs have hampered our military effort. ~attack_cost~ is necessary before we can make this assault.
0x00000455 An unfortunate investment in collidium futures has resulted in a financial shortfall, but we know that our magnificent friend won't let us down in this time of need! Could you give us ~attack_cost~?
0x00000456 War fleets cost money! This one will cost you ~attack_cost~!
0x00000457 Our highly-evolved non-materialist lifestyle has resulted in a shortage of, well, material. Could you possibly give us ~attack_cost~?
0x00000458 We've been paying attention to spiritual advancement, not fiscal prudence! But if you gave us ~attack_cost~, we could still make this assault.
0x00000459 Our war fleet is prepared, but we must also consider the cost of defending the homeland while our fleet is away. Naturally our noble ally will not want to see our home worlds suffer, and will be willing to offer us ~attack_cost~.
0x0000045A We have recently made the error of diverting funds to the 'civilian economy.' Putting the war fleet back into shape will cost ~attack_cost~.
0x0000045B This attack will cost you ~attack_cost~.
0x0000045C Rental of our ships will cost you ~attack_cost~.
0x000000D3 Here's your money.
0x000000D4 No, thank you.
0x0000045D The Grand Council has voted a declaration of war. The fleet is on its way!
0x0000045E The Grand Council will make this attack in the name of our alliance.
0x0000045F Our fleet is mobilized, and will soon be on the attack!
0x00000460 Our alliance is firm. Our ships will launch the assault at once.
0x00000461 We're totally ready for the cut-and-thrust of battle! Hup, two, three! Chaaaaaarge!
0x00000462 Our fleet is ready! We're already making plans for the victory party!
0x00000463 Let the war go forward in Spode's name!
0x00000464 Let the target feel the power of Spode's wrath!
0x00000465 The fleet is already in motion. We expect news from the front shortly.
0x00000466 Our fleet will descend upon the target. Our analysts predict victory.
0x00000467 Our ships are on the way! Let the looting commence!
0x00000468 With our magnificent ally on our side, no defeat is possible! The fleet is ready to pillage!
0x00000469 We agree to tread the Way of the Warrior. The fleet is on its way.
0x0000046A We attack! Secret Master Bifflepharb foresees victory!
0x0000046B Our ships are committed to the attack. Long live the alliance!
0x0000046C The fleet is mobilized. We shall assault the target at your request. 
0x0000046D The attack will begin immediately.
0x0000046E At your request, organic life forms will be extinguished. 
0x000000D6 Thank you.
0x0000046F The Grand Council is pleased to grant your request. The trade route shall be inaugurated soon.
0x00000470 The Grand Council has concluded that a trade route would benefit both our civilizations. Your request is granted.
0x00000471 A trade route makes sense. Our ships will soon be on their way.
0x00000472 Your request is granted. We hope that peace and civilization may accompany trade along this route.
0x00000473 We love your extra-wobbly trade goods! Let's make a deal!
0x00000474 A trade route sounds absolutely wizard! Ship us all your best party hats and refreshments!
0x00000475 We have sought counsel on this matter, and Spode has given it his blessing.
0x00000476 Let the trade route come to pass. We hope that the Word of Spode may travel along this path, as well as commerce.
0x00000477 It seems reasonable to establish a route between us. Our ships are on their way.
0x00000478 After carefully weighing the options, we've decided to favor this proposal. Our ships will arrive soon.
0x00000479 As far as we're concerned, trade equals happiness! Let's all be happy! Our interstellar boutiques are on their way!
0x0000047A Let the money flow freely between our worlds! 
0x0000047B Grand Enlightened Super Wizard Phlarb favors this proposal. We shall send our ships!
0x0000047C This request comes in answer to a two-thousand-year-old prophecy! We accept!
0x0000047D We are pleased to accept this proposal. Our ships are on their way.
0x0000047E Trade will increase the security of both our realms. We will commit our ships.
0x0000047F We expect benefit from this proposal. We accept.
0x00000480 Very well. We shall send our ships into the heart of your realm. For 'trade.' 
0x000000D8 I'm certain they'll be started shortly.
0x00000481 The Grand Council has decided that our interests do not yet coincide. We respectfully decline your proposal. 
0x00000482 The Grand Council concludes that our relations should improve before we embark on your ambitious proposal.
0x00000483 We hesitate at this stage in our relationship to open our borders to your ships. Perhaps some other time.
0x00000484 We are uncertain of the impact of your citizens on our culture. We will have to know you better.
0x00000485 We don't know if we want you around all the time! Sorry!
0x00000486 Maybe you need to work a little on your relationship skills! Let's see if you can be useful in some other ways first!
0x00000487 For now, Spode's faithful are uneasy at the presence of unbelievers. We shall have to know you better before we can accept.
0x00000488 We have asked Spode's guidance on the matter, and Spode has declined your offer. Perhaps Spode will be more favorable at a future date.
0x00000489 We find that there are too many unknowns involved. We decline your offer.
0x0000048A Our relationship has not yet progressed to the point where we can accept your offer. We must decline.
0x0000048B We hate to turn down a chance for profit, but we feel we must. We know too little about you to begin a long-term relationship. 
0x0000048C Mutual trust is necessary before a large-scale trading venture can succeed! We don't know enough about you to make that commitment. Sorry!
0x0000048D The Divination Crystals are against this idea. Sorry.
0x0000048E The Forty-Third Prophecy of Master Agpck told us that you would make this offer! Unfortunately, the prophecy also told us to decline!
0x0000048F We do not yet know if you will make an honorable trading partner. We feel we must decline.
0x00000490 Your proposal is interesting, but our relationship must improve before we can allow your ships in our skies.
0x00000491 No, this is unacceptable.
0x00000492 We decline. 
0x000000DA Okay.
0x00000493 The Grand Council has concluded that your current trade operations have you spread too thin. Feel free to contact us again when you're not so busy.
0x00000494 The Grand Council fears that trade with your Empire at this time wouldn't be prudent, you may contact us again.
0x00000495 We had hoped for a more positive outcome, but we have to conclude that trade with your civilization is not yet worth the energy expenditure.
0x00000496 It looks like you've spent too many of your trade route points already. Any more and you'll bring harm to the galaxy.~p~We must preserve our galaxy's beauty.~p~We will pass.
0x00000497 Woah, easy Trader McTraderton with all your big words and business deals.~p~We will have no trady trady with you. 
0x00000498 Though we find you personally attractive, your offer to do business we do not.~p~Party at our planet tomorrow. Bring a side dish. 
0x00000499 Spode's people are immune to the insignificant temptations that you offer us.
0x0000049A We must decline. We fear you are not fully committed to Spode's followers.
0x0000049B Good day ~player_title~ of the ~player_creature_name~.~p~Statistical data shows that your Empire is running trade at full capacity.~p~The only logical answer for us is to decline. Best of luck in the future.
0x0000049C ~player_title~ of the ~player_creature_name~, it's good to be in your presence.~p~An interstellar trade pact requires foresight and commitment on the part of both parties. Our analyses suggest that you may not be capable of upholding your end of the bargain. Therefore, we decline.
0x0000049D We hate to decline the opportunity to trade with someone as magnificent as yourself, but your current operations have you at capacity.~p~We respectfully decline your offer. 
0x0000049E We were very enthusiastic about this until we looked at the numbers... and the numbers never lie. There is no upside. Our money is best invested elsewhere, sorry.
0x0000049F We are too evolved an intelligence to engage in matters of materialism with one who feels materials matter so much.~p~We decline.
0x000004A0 For your own good, we urge you to concentrate on higher matters and leave this materialism behind.
0x000004A1 Your trade routes are already too many. Come back with a better offer, and we may reconsider.
0x000004A2 Why do you suggest that we plunder your economy? Is this some kind of trick?
0x000004A3 We decline.
0x000004A4 Your proposal has no interest for us.
0x000000DD Okay, maybe when I have fewer trade routes.
0x000000DE The Grand Council is open to suggestions from its friend ~player_title~, but we have a responsibility to our citizens not to let their hard work go unrewarded.
0x0000012B We will discuss any subject with our friend, but we would have to be strongly motivated in order to surrender sovereign territory.
0x0000012C Our ally is welcome to make an offer, but bear in mind that our citizens will expect the offer to be a fair one.
0x0000012D This subject is not without interest. The Grand Council would like to know how their advantage is best served.
0x0000012E What you suggest is not impossible, but we would have to be adequately compensated for our investment in the system. 
0x0000012F We might consider this, if there were adequate safeguards for any native life-forms, and we were compensated for the investment of time and effort we have made in the system.
0x00000130 We would be pleased to help our ally, if assurance were made concerning our own interests.
0x00000338 Our companions in the Universal Life Web are welcome to make an offer.
0x00000339 But that star is one of our prettiest! But maybe we'll let it go if you agree to support the next several festivals...
0x0000033A Normally we'd say no, but maybe if you help us make up a weeny little shortfall in our budget...?
0x0000033B Anything for you, space-buddy! But maybe you can help us with the expenses of moving out...?
0x0000033C We're totally flattered that you want our worlds, and we'd be even more flattered by a substantial offer.
0x0000033D We dislike leaving a world once we have claimed it for Spode, but we are experiencing a deficit in the budget of our Military Missionaries. Perhaps you would help us fill it?
0x0000033E That system has not been judged necessary for Spode's Plan, but we're not going to let it go for nothing.
0x0000033F ~player_title~ may make an offer, and we will consult Spode's will on the matter.
0x00000340 It will require a donation to Spode's temple in order to confer his blessing on this transfer. Perhaps you would be willing to make this offering?
0x00000341 What you suggest is not entirely unreasonable. But it is also reasonable to expect value for value.
0x00000342 The exchange you propose is logical only if the system is properly valued.
0x00000343 We would be happy to oblige you, but we expect a reasonable return.
0x00000344 We are willing to accommodate you, provided that adequate payment can be assured.
0x00000345 Your suggestion is attractive, but your true magnificence can be revealed only by the size of your pocketbook.
0x00000346 Let the sum reflect the true glory of your being!
0x00000347 Everything is for sale! Just make us a reasonable offer!
0x00000348 We'd be happy to accommodate you! Just write a big enough check!
0x00000349 You wish to purchase a star system, and we wish to buy some expensive crystals to store our spiritual energies. Perhaps an equilibrium can be reached?
0x0000034A We'd be willing to surrender control of the system to any sufficiently evolved civilization. But as ~player_creature_name~ are materialists, we'll have to settle for some of your material.
0x0000034B The World Spirit suggests that it might be willing to shift to a new custodian. If you could just cover our expenses...?
0x0000034C We are willing to break our worldly attachments to this star system, if sufficient worldly motivation is provided.
0x0000034D If our security were guaranteed, this exchange might be possible... and since security is best guaranteed by expensive weapons systems, perhaps you'd be willing to buy us some...?
0x0000034E We have invested heavily in the defense of this system, and would have to be compensated.
0x0000034F Let our honorable ally make a straightforward offer, and we will do our best to accommodate you.
0x00000350 We would be pleased to aid you in this matter, but we would have to recoup our substantial investments in the system.
0x00000351 You may offer. We may accept... or not.
0x00000352 You may suggest a sum. Let it not be small.
0x000000DF ~purchase_offer_5~
0x000000E0 ~purchase_offer_4~
0x000000E1 ~purchase_offer_3~
0x000000E2 ~purchase_offer_2~
0x000000E3 ~purchase_offer_1~
0x000000E4 Nevermind. I need some time to think about this.
0x000000E5 The Grand Council is stunned by the inadequacy of your offer.
0x00000353 The sum is completely insufficient.
0x00000354 We hoped that our ally would make a serious offer.
0x00000355 The Grand Council is not to be toyed with, even by an ally.
0x00000356 That sum is ridiculous!
0x00000357 Please do not waste our time. We have trees to plant.
0x00000358 We thought you were our ally, not a bottom-feeder.
0x00000359 We hope that any future offers will be of a more serious nature.
0x0000035A That would hardly pay for our party balloons!
0x0000035B Space-buddy, you should leave the jokes to the professionals!
0x0000035C Friend, you have been inhaling the wrong gasses!
0x0000035D How to put this in a way that will not offend your tender sensibilities?~p~NO! NO WAY! NO WAY IN A MILLION YEARS!
0x0000035E Do you think that because we are people of faith, that we are subject to delusion?
0x0000035F This sum would not suffice to polish Spode's Grand Altar!
0x00000360 Surely our ally does not intend to insult us.
0x00000361 Spode's Children will never agree to a sum this paltry.
0x00000362 Objective evidence suggests that, if you intend this as a serious offer, you suffer from delusion.
0x00000363 Your offer does not speak well for your reasoning ability.
0x00000364 Your offer does not fall within logical parameters. 
0x00000365 Your offer is startlingly small. Perhaps you misplaced the decimal point?
0x00000366 Ha-ha-ha! That's a joke... right?
0x00000367 Our magnificent friend is being silly!
0x00000368 Only our deep respect for your glorious self has prevented us from kicking this offer across the floor.
0x00000369 We expect a reasonable profit, not a visit to the poor house!
0x000004A5 This sum would hardly buy a single power crystal!
0x000004A6 No matter how long we chant over this offer, it still stinks. 
0x000004A7 Just because we are attuned to a higher plane doesn't mean we're chumps on this one!
0x000004A8 As Guru Spung said: 'When unwittingly insulted by an inferior intelligence, it is best not to reply in words, but to chant in unison, 'BFLTHHHHHHP!'
0x000004A9 Is this paltry offer meant to insult us?
0x000004AA This resembles an adequate offer as the scent of a flower resembles the flower.
0x000004AB It is only your status as an ally that prevents us from viewing this offer as an affront!
0x000004AC This money would hardly support the research on a new weapons system, let alone build one.
0x000004AD It is best not to insult your superiors.
0x000004AE The offer is inadequate. Try again.
0x000002F8 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000E6 I think we are done here.
0x000004AF The Grand Council views your offer with interest, but the Finance Committee has concluded that it is a bit low.
0x000004B0 This comes close to our requirements. Can you possibly offer more?
0x000004B1 We wonder if there is a way you can sweeten this offer before we present it to the Grand Council.
0x000004B2 The Grand Council rejects this offer with reluctance, as it comes close to the figure we had in mind.
0x000004B3 The sum does not quite meet our expectations.
0x000004B4 Can you increase the offer to cover the cost of some carbon offsets?
0x000004B5 Could you increase the offer a little, for the sake of our alliance?
0x000004B6 Your offer falls just a little short. Could you increase it?
0x000004B7 You've covered the cost of renting the hall, catering, and the beverages. Could you bump it up a little, so we can afford some entertainment?
0x000004B8 Wow! That's really close! But the price is not yet right!
0x000004B9 We were hoping to have enough to repaint our home world a gorgeous shade of magenta, but this falls a little short!
0x000004BA Even if we chop up the offer, fire it into the sky on a rocket, and let it rain down as confetti, this offer is still just a little inadequate!
0x000004BB Spode's Children were counting on a little more.
0x000004BC This does not quite meet our minimum needs.
0x000004BD We have prayed on the matter, but Spode has told us to reject the offer. If you could increase the sum but a little, Spode might yet smile upon you.
0x000004BE If you could increase the offer to cover the tithe, we would accept in Spode's name.
0x000004BF Your offer is not unreasonable, but it falls a little short.
0x000004C0 This sum does not quite meet our minimum requirements. Can you increase it?
0x000000E7 We have considered your offer from all possible perspectives, but it is still a little inadequate.
0x000004C1 We had hoped that our ally might offer a little more.
0x000004C2 This sum would be fine if we were having a sale on planets, but the sale ended last week!
0x000004C3 Your offer falls a bit short of the esteem in which we hold your magnificent self.
0x000004C4 We hate to reject an offer from our glorious friend, but the sum is a little below our expectations!
0x000004C5 You missed the target by a smidge! Can you bump it up a little?
0x000004C6 This offer will buy almost all the power crystals we need! Can you possibly increase it?
0x000004C7 Two are not yet One. But if One increases the sum but a little, One may yet be One with Two.
0x000004C8 Your fortunetellers failed to tell you the fortune we needed. Can you offer a little more?
0x000004C9 This offer almost meets the standard of material renunciation we expect in our allies! Can you renounce a little more for us, please?
0x000004CA This does not quite cover our expenses in defending this system. If you could increase the amount slightly, we would accept it.
0x000004CB The offer falls short of our expectations. Could you increase it somewhat?
0x000004CC We have viewed our honorable ally's offer with great seriousness, but it falls a little short of our present needs.
0x000004CD Your offer does you credit, but it falls short of buying us the weapons systems we need. Could you increase it?
0x000004CE Our calculations suggest the system is worth more than this.
0x000004CF Offer more money.
0x000002F9 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000E8 I'll keep that in mind.
0x000004D0 The Grand Council is pleased to accept your offer.
0x000004D1 After deliberation, the Grand Council has decided to agree to your proposal.
0x000004D2 The Grand Council accepts your offer. Let our alliance be strengthened by this agreement!
0x000004D3 The Grand Council views your proposal in a favorable light. Let the transfer take place immediately!
0x000004D4 We accept your offer, and we shall leave the system at once.
0x000004D5 We shall accede to this agreement at once.
0x000004D6 We are pleased to accept our ally's offer. Long live the alliance!
0x000004D7 Our ally's generous offer is accepted. The system is now the sovereign territory of ~player_creature_name~.
0x000004D8 Most excellent, space-buddy! We'll take down the For Sale sign, and you can move in right away!
0x000004D9 We'll take your offer, friend! Let the celebration begin!
0x000004DA We accept! And we're so proud that our little friend from the stars has become a real estate tycoon!
0x000004DB We accept! Let's sign the papers, and then do a joyful thumping dance!
0x000004DC We accept your offer in Spode's name.
0x000004DD Spode looks with favor upon this offer. We agree.
0x000004DE After prayer, we have decided to accept your offer. Spode's friend shall have this system.
0x000004DF Spode's will shall be fulfilled. Our ally shall have the system.
0x000004E0 You offer a reasonable sum. We will accept.
0x000004E1 Your offer takes all contingencies into account. We shall sign this agreement.
0x000004E2 We are pleased at our ally's perspicacity. We shall gladly accept his offer.
0x000004E3 Your offer is shrewd and intelligent. We are honored to accept.
0x000004E4 We are delighted to accept our glorious friend's offer! 
0x000004E5 You are a shrewd dealer, my friend! We accept!
0x000004E6 We caper with delight at the splendor and wisdom of our glorious ally! The system is yours!
0x000000E9 We are honored to serve you! The sale is closed, and the system is yours!
0x000004E7 Let our minds move in harmonious rhythm. We accept.
0x000004E8 Your offer is accepted. May this agreement serve the greater wisdom!
0x000004E9 Our minds are in unison! We accept your offer.
0x000004EA We can see from your aura that your offer is sincere. We are happy to accept.
0x000004EB The offer is accepted. May we continue to live in peace and security.
0x000004EC This is a fair price. We accept.
0x000004ED We are pleased to accept our ally's fair and generous offer.
0x000004EE We accept our ally's honorable proposal. May our alliance be strengthened as a result!
0x000004EF The price is adequate. You may have the system.
0x000004F0 The sum is sufficient. We agree.
0x000000EA Pleasure doing business with you.
0x000004F1 The Grand Council is astounded by your generosity. We accept.
0x000004F2 Your offer is beyond our expectations. The Grand Council will conclude the deal immediately.
0x000004F3 Our ally's offer is generous beyond our dreams. The Grand Council is pleased to accept.
0x000004F4 The Grand Council is delighted by the scope of this magnificent offer. We accept. 
0x000004F5 Your offer is surprising in its generosity. We are pleased to accept.
0x000004F6 Your magnanimous offer surpasses all expectation. The deal is done.
0x000004F7 With this fabulous sum, we can extend the Life Web to many worlds! Let us sign the agreement at once!
0x000004F8 You honor us with these vast and unexpected riches. We shall try to be worthy of your trust.
0x000004F9 We could purchase half a dozen systems with this money! Thanks very much!
0x000004FA We're not so stunned by this fabulous offer that we won't accept it!
0x000004FB Wow! It's like the Money Fairy just flew down on gossamer wings! We accept!
0x000004FC It's like tons of cash just moved into our closets of their own accord! We'll take the offer!
0x000004FD We are overwhelmed by your generosity to Spode's cause. We accept your offer.
0x000004FE Spode must have touched your heart in order for you to have made this colossal offer. We are pleased to accept in Spode's name.
0x000004FF Your astounding generosity will make possible a whole new era in the worship of Spode. We are certain you will be rewarded in the afterlife.
0x00000500 Glory be to Spode! You offer us money beyond our wildest expectations! Let praises be sung!
0x00000501 You have significantly over-valued the system, but we are pleased to accept the money anyway.
0x00000502 Your offer is marked by irrational exuberance. We shall accept while the madness lasts.
0x00000503 You have paid far too much for this system, but obviously you can afford it.
0x00000504 Our alliance will be much strengthened by this agreement. You will have a mediocre star system, and we will have huge, unanticipated sums of money.
0x00000505 YES!!! YES!!! WE ACCEPT!!! WE'RE RICH!!! WE'RE RICH, RICH, RICH, RICH, RICH!!!!!
0x00000506 The magnificence of your offer is beyond imagining! We'll try to imagine how we're going to spend it!
0x00000507 With this magnificent, generous offer you have sought to buy our friendship... and you have succeeded! Let the alliance thrive!
0x00000508 This colossal sum is the epitome of generosity! And since you've got so much money, maybe you'd like to spend some of it in our emporium!
0x00000509 We hadn't expected that you would surrender materialism to quite this extent! We accept!
0x0000050A As enlightened beings, we hasten to accept this vast sum of money in exchange for what are, after all, only a few rocks floating around in the vacuum.
0x0000050B With this overwhelmingly generous offer, Two have become One. You have become One with your new star system, and we have become One with fabulous amounts of money!
0x0000050C We praise your higher wisdom in ridding yourself of the corrupting influence of this colossal amount of money. May you learn the mysteries of the spirit. We, on the other hand, will study the mysteries of 'compound interest.'
0x0000050D You have greatly overvalued the system. We accept the money, but if you intended the extra as a bribe, you have failed.
0x0000050E Your excessive generosity surprises us. If security can be bought, then we will now buy it.
0x0000050F Our ally flatters us with such enormous generosity. Rest assured that we will spend this vast sum on objects that will enhance our alliance.
0x00000510 We are startled by the size of this sum, but we will try to prove worthy of it.
0x00000511 The system is not at all worth what you have paid.
0x00000512 If you hoped to bribe us with this enormous sum, you have failed.
0x000000EC You're welcome.
0x00000669 As you wish. Our ships have ceased their departure from our ports. You will see our spice no more.
0x00000301 According to section 1.0004B of the Galactic Trade Embargo Agreement, you have every right to sever this trade agreement.~p~Let us know if you change your mind.
0x00000108 You no longer care to share Spice resources with us? That's too bad, we will spread our resources to those more needy. 
0x00000109 Wow... this came out of nowhere...~p~This is probably a good thing. We don't want to exploit our planet's natural resources to exhaustion. 
0x0000010A Fine! We didn't want to trade with you anyways.~p~Keep it together ~race~, don't cry in front of the customers.~p~Boohoohoo...
0x00000179 You can't stop trading with us now. We need that Spice to pay for our annual Dance 'til you Drop party.~p~We've already put a deposit on the DJ. The caterer has already started making the Ziggs in a Blanket. Mmmhhh, those are good. 
0x0000017A Spode will not be pleased. We will pray for you. 
0x0000017B May you find peace with yourself after this decision. We will pray for you. 
0x0000017C This decision seems highly illogical. Maybe you will reconsider after coming to your senses.
0x0000017D All of the data shows this trade agreement as being highly profitable for both parties.~p~This doesn't compute.
0x0000017E This is terrible news, simply terrible.~p~We value you as customer and hope that you reconsider.~p~Can you fill out a feedback slip?
0x0000017F This is going to impact our upcoming profit reports. We wish you'd reconsider.~p~Who do we have to fire? 
0x0000018E It is said, 'All good things must come to an end.' It appears we have come to that end, friend. 
0x000002FC We shall part ways on good terms and high spirits. May the stars shine upon you. 
0x000002FD You will be looked upon as less than honorable for this action. Be gone.
0x000002FE Where is the honor in breaking one's trade agreement? Leave us. 
0x000002FF The Grox do not care what you do. Your fate has already been decided. 
0x0000066A Thank you for your understanding.
0x000000ED This star and all of its planets are yours, just give us the chance to pack our things and leave.
0x0000058D Cease your attack, and we will evacuate this system and leave it to you.
0x0000058E We reluctantly conclude that it is hopeless to continue the fight. We will surrender this system if you permit us to leave unharmed.
0x0000058F In order to spare our worlds further devastation, we will agree to surrender this system if you will order your forces to stand down.
0x00000590 Your superior technology has won the day. We will leave this system to you if you will allow us to evacuate in peace.
0x00000591 All right, you big bully! We'll agree to leave if you'll agree to stop shooting!
0x00000592 Your big lasers and stern martial prowess have won the day! If you'll give us enough time to pack a few of our things, we'll leave the planet to you!
0x00000593 Spode has decreed for us a time of trial. We will abandon the system if you will agree to stop shooting.
0x00000594 The ways of Spode are ineffable. He has decreed your triumph. If you will permit us to evacuate in peace, you may have the system and all that is in it.
0x00000595 It is only reasonable to conclude that we have lost the battle. If you will stop your attack, we will evacuate and leave the system to you.
0x00000596 Your tactics have proven superior. If you will agree to a brief suspension of hostilities, we will cease our resistance and surrender this world.
0x00000597 You need not continue to prove your magnificence! If you'll agree to a cease-fire, we'll abandon the system and leave everything to you!
0x00000598 Stop, stop! If you'll agree to suspend the war, we'll evacuate and abandon our property!
0x00000599 Your ruthless materialist philosophy has won the day! If you will agree to a halt in your aggression, we will evacuate our survivors and leave the system to you.
0x0000059A You're going to get a ton of bad karma for this! But your karmic burden may be lightened if you agree to a cease-fire so that we can peacefully abandon this system.
0x0000059B It must be admitted that your tactics were superior. If you will agree to a cease-fire, we will cease our resistance and leave this system to you.
0x0000059C You have learned well, warrior! We will leave this system to you, if you will agree to a cease-fire.
0x0000059D Grox surrender. Does not compute. 
0x000000EE I claim this place.
0x000000EF I'd rather destroy what's left than let you escape!
0x000000F0 We surrender! Please, we cannot rival your might. Take your spoils and leave us be, we beg of you!
0x0000059E The Grand Council has decided that our best option is to surrender.
0x0000059F We come to you in hopes that you will accept our surrender.
0x000005A0 In order to spare the environment further damage, we now offer to surrender.
0x000005A1 This war has gone on long enough. We will surrender.
0x000005A2 Okay! You get the award for 'Meanest Culture in the Galaxy.' We give up! 
0x000005A3 We all have a big party to attend, so we thought we'd save everyone time and surrender.
0x000005A4 It is Spode's will that we hang on the brink of ruin! We will surrender, if you will spare what's left of us!
0x000005A5 We must preserve what is left! If you will spare Spode's Children, we will agree to surrender.
0x000005A6 Available data suggests that it is futile to continue the conflict. We therefore offer to surrender.
0x000005A7 Further resistance would seem to be useless. Will you accept our surrender?
0x000005A8 Stop! Will you accept our surrender before you destroy the remains of our trade goods?
0x000005A9 No more shooting! We will surrender if you'll leave us the modest wealth that remains!
0x000005AA Our spiritual superiority has not helped us in this struggle! We offer to surrender!
0x000005AB We can't hold out long enough for you to be crushed beneath the weight of your own karma! We surrender!
0x000005AC Your forces have fairly won the day. We offer honorable surrender.
0x000005AD Your tactics have been surprisingly effective. We offer surrender.
0x000005AE Grox surrender? Does not compute. 
0x000000F1 Yes, let there be peace.
0x000000F2 No, I think I'd gain more from your destruction.
0x000000F3 You think that money can solve this problem? Hmm... That could be.
0x000005AF It is only fair that those in the wrong offer reparations. The Grand Council suggests great generosity.
0x000005B0 The Grand Council does not alter its principles, but for the sake of clarity we ask you to elucidate your offer.
0x000005B1 We value life, not cash, but as you are a materialist culture, perhaps depriving you of money will serve as punishment enough. How much do you offer?
0x000005B2 Money may serve to help repair the damage you have caused. How much?
0x000005B3 You'd better offer enough to cover the costs of the Peace Festival and several stylish new outfits!
0x000005B4 But we're having such fun blowing you to bits! You'd have to offer lots of money to divert us from our sport!
0x000005B5 Spode does not make peace so easily. But perhaps if the tithe were large enough...?
0x000005B6 We might consider this sincere atonement if the sum were large enough to cause you genuine pain.
0x000005B7 We may consider peace, but only if your offer is sufficient.
0x000005B8 We require that the offer be equitable.
0x000005B9 You can absolutely change our minds with a big enough bribe! How much?
0x000005BA You'd have to compensate us in full for the loot we'd otherwise plunder from your worlds!
0x000005BB We despise your offer of material compensation, but we suppose that if you suffer financial loss, it's only the forces of karma at work. How much do you offer the Lords of Karma?
0x000005BC Material possessions are choking your Higher Self. How much are you willing to sacrifice?
0x000005BD On one end of the balance, we despise your offer of cash as a means of settling this dispute. On the other end, we'd like to be able to pay for new weapons systems. We counsel tilting the balance with a weighty substance such as gold.
0x000005BE We would expect an offer of money from one who does not understand honor. Yet... as you have no honor... you can scarcely offer anything else. How much?
0x000005BF Peace means nothing to The Grox. 
0x000000F4 ~peace_offer_5~
0x000000F5 ~peace_offer_4~
0x000000F6 ~peace_offer_3~
0x000000F7 ~peace_offer_2~
0x000000F8 ~peace_offer_1~
0x000000F9 Nevermind. War is perhaps the less expensive alternative.
0x000000FA This paltry sum isn't even close! With this pathetic offering, you've done nothing but give us more reason to crush you.
0x000005C0 The Grand Council urges you to reconsider this paltry offer.
0x000005C1 The Grand Council considers this sum grossly inadequate.
0x000005C2 This insignificant sum shows that you aren't serious about the peace!
0x000005C3 This sum will barely suffice to plant a tree! 
0x000005C4 This is a joke! Right? Right?
0x000005C5 We totally applaud your ability to deliver a laugh line right in the middle of a desperate struggle for your own existence! But we're not going to stop shooting until you get a lot more serious.
0x000005C6 Do you think a tiny sum such as this can restrain Spode's Holy Warriors?
0x000005C7 You insult us with this ridiculous sum!
0x000005C8 Your analysis of the situation seems faulty. Such an insignificant offering will not tempt us.
0x000005C9 This tiny sum is in itself evidence of your defective reasoning skills.
0x000005CA Get serious! We'd earn lots more by plundering you!
0x000005CB Don't try to lowball us when we're pointing guns at you!
0x000005CC Not only do you assume that we'd want your filthy money, but now you try to cheat us! 
0x000005CD We're only interested in helping you to achieve spiritual Oneness through sacrifice of material goods. This sacrifice is ridiculously small- and you want Oneness, don't you?
0x000005CE We scorn this ridiculous sum!
0x000005CF Your offer is deeply inadequate! Fight on, or impoverish yourself further!
0x000005D0 Money means nothing to The Grox.
0x000000FB Oops. We may have miscalculated.
0x000000FC Haha! Nice try, but you'll have to better than that to soothe our rage.
0x000005D1 The Grand Council does not consider this sum to be entirely adequate.
0x000005D2 This offer of reparations does not quite meet our standards.
0x000005D3 This sum does not compensate us for our pain and suffering.
0x000005D4 While we find the idea of reparations adequate in principle, this sum is inadequate in practice.
0x000005D5 At last you have our attention! Unfortunately this sum won't keep our attention for long.
0x000005D6 We're sorry, but this amount won't quite pay for all the weapons we've been blasting you with!
0x000005D7 We are willing to give you credit for sincerity, but the sum is inadequate.
0x000005D8 Spode requires a larger tithe.
0x000005D9 Your reasoning is not far off the mark, but it still falls short.
0x000005DA A cost-benefit analysis shows that this offer does not fully compensate us for our efforts.
0x000005DB The sum had us sitting up and taking notice! But our attention is wandering again- can you offer more?
0x000005DC Not bad for a first offer! We'll look forward to your second!
0x000005DD This sum is not quite enough to sway us from the Path of the Spirit Warrior.
0x000005DE We've checked with the Oracle, and she says, 'Ask for more!'
0x000005DF This may pay for an ordinary weapons system, but we want the one with all the options! Make a better offer!
0x000005E0 This is not enough to compensate for the joy of annihilating you!
0x000005E1 Money means nothing to The Grox.
0x000000FD I'll keep that in mind.
0x000000FE Ah, very well. We will let this offering appease us for now.
0x000005E2 The Grand Council is pleased to accept your offer.
0x000005E3 The Grand Council finds your offer adequate. Let there be peace between our peoples.
0x000005E4 This will compensate us adequately for the destruction and expense of the war. 
0x000005E5 We are a peaceful people by nature, and will accept this offer in token of the future friendship between our species.
0x000005E6 This is enough for a totally awesome weekend! The peace is on, space-buddy!
0x000005E7 With this money, we can all have fantastic new outfits! Let's give peace a chance!
0x000005E8 In exchange for this money, the Warrior of Spode will withhold their wrath... for now.
0x000005E9 The tithe is adequate. Let there be peace.
0x000005EA Our analyses coincide. Let us settle our differences.
0x000005EB For once, your conclusions are rational. Let there be peace.
0x000005EC That is a completely adequate sum! Let's be friends! And don't forget that we'd like you even more if you bought some of our merchandise!
0x000005ED We'll take the money! And we'll take even more, if you visit the boutique!
0x000005EE In order to benefit your Higher Selves, we will relieve you of the karmic burden of this money. There shall be peace between us.
0x000005EF We assure you that after we chant over this money to remove its bad karma, we will use the sum only for spiritually elevated purposes!
0x000005F0 To the victor belong the spoils! It would be wise for you never to tempt us again to your destruction.
0x000005F1 We are honored to crush your forces, ravage your planets, take your money, and proclaim a victory.
0x000005F2 What is peace? Grox will cease destruction of current target, temporarily. 
0x000000FF What a relief!
0x00000100 Oh my, yes! I'm quite certain you won't have any trouble with us now. Quite generous of you!
0x000005F3 Your astounding generosity shall be rewarded by immediate peace.
0x000005F4 The reparations are beyond our expectations. The Grand Council shall ratify the peace instantly.
0x000005F5 This sum is sufficient to turn a dozen worlds green! Let there be peace between us!
0x000005F6 With such a vast sum, you have truly renounced your materialist ethic! 
0x000005F7 Now we've got to be careful so that we don't get crushed by great big wads of money falling from the sky! Let's have peace... especially now that we're too rich to do any fighting!
0x000005F8 Thanks to your astounding generosity, we'll be able to afford the new fashion for solid collidium fixtures in our homes!
0x000005F9 We did not expect such a generous atonement. With this, you show yourself genuinely repentant.
0x000005FA Spode must have moved your heart to this extraordinary contribution! In his name, we accept this proposal of peace.
0x000005FB Our analysis suggests that you must be seriously deranged to give us this much money. Nevertheless, we accept.
0x000005FC We accept both your offer of peace, and this colossal extravagance of a gift.
0x000005FD WAHOOO!!! WE'LL TAKE IT!!! WE'RE RICH!!! WE'RE RICH!!! WE'RE RICH!!!
0x000005FE If we'd known you had that much money, we would have declared war earlier!
0x000005FF By giving away this colossal sum, you have taken your first step toward spiritual wisdom.
0x00000600 As spiritually advanced beings, we will be far better custodians of this vast and unexpected sum than you. You may have your peace. 
0x00000601 You must have been insane with terror to offer us this much! We take the money, and advise you to remain terrified.
0x00000602 This sum will pay for weapons systems beyond our wildest imaginings! We'll take the money! And the guns! And the bombs! And the rockets...!
0x00000603 What is peace? Grox will cease destruction of current target, temporarily. 
0x00000101 Let there be peace at any price.
0x000000BB The Grand Council is not moved by fiduciary inducements, but wonders how much you will offer.
0x000000BC Tell us how much you offer, so that the Grand Council does not waste its time.
0x000000BD The Grand Council views your suggestion with interest.
0x000000BE The Grand Council will welcome any gift, but in order to best utilize the money will need to know the total.
0x000000BF The Grand Council is delighted by the generosity of its ally. How far does this generosity extend?
0x000000C0 Aid comes at a useful time! In order to know how best to employ it, we will need to know the total.
0x000000C1 How much of your wretched money can we expect?
0x00000102 How much of your tainted money do you offer us?
0x00000123 We're interested, but we need a clearer idea of your offer.
0x00000124 At present your offer seems a little vague. Can you be more specific?
0x00000125 In order to know how best to allocate this generous gift, we will need an idea of its dimension.
0x00000126 Any contributions will be used to extend the Universal Life Web. How much did you say it was?
0x00000127 Oh, look! ~player_title~ has come to bribe us! How much are you offering, ~player_title~?
0x00000128 Bribery is so amusing! How much amusement do you have in mind?
0x00000129 Cute little ~player_title~ has come back with pots of money! How much money do you have in the pots, ~player_title~?
0x0000012A You've arrived just in time for the Festival of Pointless Roistering! How many days can we afford to roister?
0x0000018F We'll pick Door Number One, ~player_title~! What do we see behind it?
0x00000190 We think you're wonderful, witty, and amusing! How much money do you plan to amuse us with?
0x00000191 The faithful of Spode are immune to bribery, but still we wonder how much our friendship is worth to you.
0x00000192 You fail to understand that our values are moral and spiritual, not material. Nevertheless we may find something worthwhile to do with... how much did you say, exactly?
0x00000193 Spode's followers are pleased by any offering, and wonder about the size of your contribution to our cause.
0x00000194 Spode tells us that generosity is one of the Exalted Virtues. Exactly how exalted are you planning to be, today?
0x00000195 ~player_title~ will be pleased to know that your offering will be used to fund our missionary efforts! How much of a contribution can we expect?
0x00000196 Any contributions will be put to good works, such as smiting our mutual enemies! How much smiting can you afford?
0x00000197 Primitive thinkers often believe that objective thought can be influenced by talismans such as money. 
0x00000198 Your thinking is sadly deranged if you believe that our judgments can be swayed by... by how much exactly?
0x00000199 We view your offer favorably, but would be interested in knowing the details.
0x0000019A We are encouraged by your offer. How much we are to be encouraged remains to be seen.
0x0000019B We welcome our ally, and we wonder about the nature of his gift.
0x0000019C Our ally is wise in trusting us to put his gift to be best possible use. What was the gift, exactly?
0x000001B1 Our bad opinion of you can be totally erased by a large enough contribution to our well-being! How much swag did you bring?
0x000001B2 If you think it's possible to sway our opinion with an offer of cold hard cash, you're absolutely right! How badly do you want us to agree with you?
0x000001B3 The glorious appearance of ~player_title~ is only enhanced by the large bundles of cash you have brought with you. How much is in the bundles, exactly?
0x000001B4 Such magnificence! Such poise! Such intelligence! Such bulging money sacks! How many money sacks, exactly?
0x00000329 We drool with delight at the appearance of our ally! What does it have in its pockets?
0x0000032A The appearance of ~player_title~ is sublime... perfection itself. And we know that our ally will not visit without a gift. May we help you count it?
0x0000032B We reject any attempt to bring us into alignment with your materialist lifestyle. How much material did you bring, exactly?
0x0000032C Your crude attempt at bribery bounces off the impermeable armor of our spiritual superiority. How crude is your attempt, by the way?
0x0000032D Though we have transcended the materialist lifestyle, nevertheless we find it useful to possess some medium of exchange when dealing with unenlightened races. How much did you bring?
0x0000032E While our spiritual advancement is of primary concern, we nevertheless still possess material bodies that have material needs. How many of our needs are you planning to fill?
0x0000032F Your aura shows your compassionate and generous nature. How far does your generosity extend?
0x00000330 Surrendering attachment to material possessions is the first step on the path to wisdom. How many material possessions are you going to surrender?
0x00000331 As true warriors, we scorn any attempt to sway us with mere money! Tell us how much cash you brought, so that we can laugh at it!
0x00000332 We are amused by your presumption that we are susceptible to bribes. How large a bribe did you bring, contemptible one?
0x00000333 Any gift will be used to purchase many shiny weapons. How many weapons, exactly, can we add to our arsenal?
0x00000334 Warrior spirit, alas, is not as exportable as cash. How much cash did you intend to export?
0x00000335 Our ally is welcome among us, and your generous gift will be used to the benefit of both our species. May we count it for you?
0x00000336 Our ally's gift is as welcome as the first delicate flowers of spring. How many flowers, exactly, do we behold?
0x00000337 Apparently you failed to notice that machines have no use for money. Nevertheless we might find the cash useful in bribing greedy, short-sighted organic life-forms to destroy their own civilizations. How much did you bring?
0x00000103 ~large_gift_amount~
0x00000104 ~medium_gift_amount~
0x00000105 ~small_gift_amount~
0x00000106 Nevermind. I changed my mind.
0x00000303 Heeeeeeeeeelp!
0x00000304 The Grand Council hopes you will forgive our lack of a formal reception. We stand at a critical moment.~p~That is to say... Heeeeeeeelp!
0x00000305 Heeeeeeeeeelp!
0x00000306 These guys just do not get our sense of humor. Help!
0x00000307 You're interrupting an existential crisis! 
0x00000308 The White Hand of Enlightenment and the Dark Hand of Chaos are about to unite and strangle you if you don't leave!
0x00000309 We're in the middle of a crisis!
0x0000030A We're busy right now! Help us or call again later!
0x0000030B Woe is us! 
0x0000030D We are on the verge of a catastrophe! 
0x0000030E We are busy on Spode's affairs right now.
0x0000030F We're involved in a complex situation at the moment!
0x00000310 We're in crisis! We can't talk now!
0x00000311 You come at a critical time!
0x00000312 We await your briefing. But it will have to be later.
0x00000313 You are not included in our calculations at present. 
0x00000314 You risk extinction by speaking to us at this moment!
0x0000030C We're in a crisis! Spend money or otherwise make yourself useful!
0x0000019D Can't talk now Captain, we're under attack.~p~We can use your help. 
0x000001A2 There's no time for talk right now, only action.~p~Mission Control out.
0x000001A3 Less talk, more go. There's a crisis down here. 
0x0000010C Yes
0x0000010D We are traumatized by the recent Grox raid. Let us breathe.~p~Let's talk later.
0x00000667 Everyone is a bit shaken up by the recent Grox attack. It would be best if you came back later Captain. 
0x00000604 The Grand Council is fully occupied with the aftermath of a Grox attack. We are unable to speak with you at this time.
0x000001A5 The Galactic Security Force is here assessing the damage after the recent Grox invasion.~p~Please come back at a time when we're available to talk.
0x00000605 The evil Grox machines have attacked us! We can't deal with you right now- please come back later.
0x00000606 As the result of an attack by the vicious anti-Life forces of the Grox, we're very busy right now! You are welcome to return at another time.
0x00000607 The party's over- we were attacked by the Grox! You're welcome to come roister another time.
0x00000608 The Grox attacked us! We don't know why... Maybe they didn't like the spring hat collection! We're having a full-fledged fashion emergency right now, so we can't talk!
0x00000609 The Children of Spode were just attacked by the diabolical machines of the Grox! We do not have time to deal with petitioners right now- come back later.
0x0000060A The hell-machines of the Grox have come to smite us! Come back at a later time!
0x0000060B We are re-evaluating our data in the aftermath of a Grox attack. Come back at another time.
0x0000060C The Grox have launched an attack upon us. We are attempting to determine the logic of this, and have no time for other matters. Come back later.
0x0000060D The Grox blew up our stuff! The boutique is closed! Come back later!
0x0000060E The Grox attacked us! We can't decide whether to raise our prices or have a fire sale, so come again later!
0x0000060F If our auras seem dark, it's because we were attacked by the Grox! We're chanting for a protective shield, so we can't talk to you right now. Come another time.
0x00000610 We were trying to explain numerology to the Grox, and they attacked us! We're busy right now... Come back later.
0x00000611 We're mobilizing our forces after an unprovoked attack by the Grox. We're too busy to deal with you right now... Maybe later.
0x00000612 We have been attacked by the Grox. We are preparing massive retaliation, and can't deal with other matters. Return later, after our triumph.
0x0000010E Sorry. I didn't know.
0x0000051B Yes, Captain. Wasn't the information properly uploaded into your Mission Log?
0x0000051C All inquires should be referred to the Bureau Of Inquiries, especially those involving interstellar flight contracts.~p~Of course, per galactic policy, the information has also been recorded in your Mission Log?
0x0000051D Clear your mind and the details of your quest shall reveal itself.~p~Of course, it is also within your control to open your log of Missions.~p~
0x0000051E Oh ya... of course... it's such a bother to focus and remember things... Ya know. Why must we be driven by details... Let nature guide us... that's what we say...~p~What were you saying... we weren't paying attention...~p~...maybe you have a Mission Log or something...
0x0000051F ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Your assignment was clear. I'm sure you took sufficient notations in your Mission Log.
0x00000520 Of course, of course. I would have thought you would have left already... but no matter, no matter.~p~Check your Mission Log for details of the contract.~p~
0x00000521 Floo! As to hold a handful of water, the details of your task run from your mind. Ha ho!~p~It is a good thing you have a Mission Log to remind you of such things like names and places, stars and races!
0x00000522 ~race~ gave you all instruction in Mission Log. Why you bother us again.
0x00000523 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~ has made a sacred contract with the ~race~.~p~Are you a treacherous person, or is your Mission Log unreliable?
0x00000524 You dare to return to The Grox without completing your task!~p~We do not condescend to repeat ourselves. Your Mission Log will supply you with enough information.
0x00000525 Despite the orders uploaded into your Mission Log, you have failed to complete your assignment. You will complete the mission immediately.
0x0000036A The Grand Council is willing to accept your offer, and hopes for a continuing improvement of relations.
0x0000036B The Grand Council offers its thanks, and hopes our relations will continue to improve.
0x0000036C We are pleased to accept our friend's offer in the name of the Grand Council, and we present you with this Certificate of Commendation, Third Class.
0x0000036D The Grand Council gratefully accepts your offer, and trusts that our friendship will continue to grow.
0x0000036E We are delighted to accept this contribution from our ally. The Grand Council will always be receptive to ~player_title~'s suggestions.
0x0000036F The Grand Council gratefully accepts this donation, and awards you the title Friend of the Federation.
0x00000370 We thank you for this gift, which will be used in the service of the Universal Life Web.
0x00000371 We hope that our relations will continue to improve.
0x00000372 Thank you for this gracious contribution. May our friendship continue.
0x00000373 We thank you for this donation, and we assure ~player_title~ that our friendship will continue to improve.
0x00000374 This contribution will be used to strengthen our alliance!
0x00000375 The Universal Life Web will benefit from your generous donation! Is there any way we can help our ally?
0x00000376 As a result of this gift, our relationship... formerly glacial... can now be described as frigid.
0x00000377 Our view of you has changed. Somewhat.
0x00000378 This contribution will go a long way to funding our next party! Let's be friends!
0x00000379 Thank you, star-buddy! Be assured that we're going to spend it all on something frivolous!
0x0000037A Your noble gift will be put to good use! Do you favor creating lakes full of chip dip, or painting the entire planet an eye-catching shade of chartreuse?
0x0000037B Toga toga toga!
0x0000037C We accept this gift in Spode's name, and we hope that Spode will enter your heart in the course of our improving relationship.
0x0000037D Spode's faithful will put this offering to good use. You remind us that nonbelievers are also part of Spode's plan.
0x0000037E In Spode's name, we thank our friend for this generous gift. May Spode continue to bring us closer together.
0x0000037F You will be delighted to know that our friend's contribution will go to enhance Spode's cause.
0x00000380 This magnanimous gift from our ally will be dedicated to the glorification of Spode.
0x00000381 This contribution will ensure that our alliance will continue to do Spode's great work.
0x00000382 Thank you for the gift. We will put it to rational use.
0x00000383 Perhaps your species is useful after all.
0x00000384 We thank you for your gift, and hope out friendship will continue to improve.
0x00000385 We thank our friend ~player_title~, and we assure you that we shall put this donation to good use.
0x00000386 We will not forget our ally's generous contribution to our cause. We will be happy to work with you on furthering our mutual objectives.
0x00000387 We thank our ally ~player_title~ for this splendid contribution. Rest assured that we stand ready to advance your interests as well as our own.
0x00000388 We're a smidge more inclined to like you, though we'd rather you spent more money. Perhaps you can make up for this lack in our boutique?
0x00000389 We accept your offer, and hope that we'll remain friendly enough so that more offers will come soon. 
0x0000038A Our friend ~player_title~ speaks our language! How may we help you?
0x0000038B Truly it is said, 'He who purchases something of value is a customer, but he who gives you stacks of money for no reason is a friend for life!'
0x0000038C We caper and gibber at the magnificence of your gift! Let the alliance flourish!
0x0000038D We break into songs of joy at your very appearance! Would you like to be worshiped as a god?
0x0000038E It appears that your materialist consciousness is capable of instruction and spiritual growth. How may we enlighten you?
0x0000038F We begin to perceive a modicum of spiritual worth within your unevolved minds.
0x00000390 The gift is accepted. We shall form a circle and meditate on friendship.
0x00000391 Your gift is very nice! May our auras commingle!
0x00000392 Our ally's gift is magnanimous! We shall chant the Hymn of Harmony!
0x00000393 Through this gift, our species may achieve Oneness!
0x00000394 We look upon you with renewed interest. Perhaps you may be of use after all.
0x00000395 The cat seeks to flatter the tiger. Yet the cat is not without its own utility.
0x00000396 We thank you. Your gift will be used to better enhance our security.
0x00000397 Your gift strengthens our friendship.
0x00000398 We shall use this magnificent contribution to enhance the effectiveness of our alliance.
0x00000399 Our alliance is greatly strengthened by this generous gift.
0x0000039A We see no reason not to take the money.
0x0000039B For reasons beyond your insignificant understanding, we accept.
0x00000120 We will take your offering as a sign of submission.
0x000001A6 We accept your offerings, Fuh... fuh... frrrii... does not compute.
0x0000039C Okay, well lemme ask you something else.
0x0000039D Can I ask about something else?
0x0000039E I have another question, then.
0x0000039F There is something else I'd like to discuss.
0x000003A0 Good-bye.
0x000003A1 So be it.
0x000003A2 The Grand Council accepts this donation, but its attitude toward you is unchanged.
0x000003A3 Your attempt to sway our principles has met with failure. 
0x000003A4 We thank ~player_title~ for this contribution, but we must remind you that our policy is already decided.
0x000003A5 The Grand Council gratefully accepts your offer, though we regret to say that our agenda for the future has already been determined.
0x000003A6 In the name of our alliance we will accept this, though we must inform ~player_title~ that no money could possibly improve our already-steadfast friendship.
0x000003A7 This money is an embarrassment of riches. We accept it out of courtesy, but our relationship is already so close that it can scarcely be improved.
0x000003A8 Far from changing our minds, this tainted money will be used to advance our struggle against you!
0x000003A9 We laugh at your paltry attempts to alter our principles.
0x000003AA We thank you for this donation, though our friendship will not be affected in any way.
0x000003AB Thank you for this gracious contribution, even though our principles remain firm.
0x000003AC We really don't need this money, but thank you anyway.
0x000003AD Our relationship is already firm, but we'll take your donation out of politeness.
0x000003AE If there's anything worse than a bribe, it's a bribe by a cheapskate.
0x000003AF Did you think we'd sell ourselves cheap?
0x000003B0 Your earnest attempt to improve our relationship is declined... but we'll take the money anyway.
0x000003B1 Thank you, but we already view you as our star-buddy!
0x000003B2 You don't need to bribe us any more! We already like you... lots! 
0x000003B3 Our alliance is already as strong as steel... we don't need money, too.
0x000003B4 Your gift, intended to corrupt us, has only strengthened our resolve.
0x000003B5 Spode, who sees into your hearts, knows that with this gift you intended to infect us with your materialist ways.
0x000003B6 We thank you for the contribution, but our ideas remain unaltered.
0x000003B7 We'll take the money for Spode's cause, but our relationship will remain unaltered.
0x000003B8 Though our alliance is already unshakeable, we nevertheless accept this glorious gift in Spode's name.
0x000003B9 This gift was completely unnecessary, as we are already united in doing Spode's work.
0x000003BA Before we put this money to use, we shall scan it for infectious organisms.
0x000003BB The scale of your offer is... interesting. Puny, but interesting.
0x000003BC We thank you for the contribution, disappointed though you will be if you hoped this would alter our relationship.
0x000003BD Though our friendship is unchanged, rest assured that we shall put this donation to good use.
0x000003BE We thank our ally, though this gift was unnecessary.
0x000003BF We thank our ally ~player_title~ for this splendid contribution, but our alliance already stands on a firm foundation.
0x000003C0 Is that all?
0x000003C1 This donation has succeeded in changing our opinion of you. Where once we merely suspected you of being a cheapskate, now we know it for certain!
0x000003C2 Thanks for the contribution, but we regret to inform you that the prices in the boutique remain unchanged.
0x000003C3 Your gift was nice, but our friendship remains unchanged. 
0x000003C4 Your magnificence is unparalleled, but your gift was completely unnecessary! Wait, wait! Did I actually say that?
0x000003C5 Your glorious gift will be received with paeans of joy, but our alliance remains unaltered.
0x000003C6 Your attempt at bribery has proved useless.
0x000003C7 You are foolish indeed if you thought this crude scheme would accomplish anything.
0x000003C8 We thank you, though the fundamental aspects of our relationship remain unaltered.
0x000003C9 Despite this crude attempt to gain our favor, our friendship remains unaltered.
0x000003CA Our alliance is already firm, and any currency other than that of honor is superfluous.
0x000003CB We thank our ally, but any further contributions are completely unnecessary.
0x000003CC We reject you and your crude materialist consciousness!
0x000003CD This action is the product of an unevolved mind.
0x000003CE Our friend's gift is accepted, though our principles remain firm. 
0x000003CF We appreciate the offer, though our relationship will remain unchanged until you evolve a bit more on the spiritual plane.
0x000003D0 Our alliance is based on a higher principles than crude materialism.
0x000003D1 We are already One. Any gifts remain superfluous.
0x000003D2 We'll take it, but this bribe will do you no good.
0x000003D3 We are Grox. Our goals do not change like prices in a market.
0x000003D4 Okay, well lemme ask you something else.
0x000003D5 Can I ask about something else?
0x000003D6 I have another question, then.
0x000003D7 There is something else I'd like to discuss.
0x000003D8 Good-bye.
0x000003D9 So be it.
0x00000131 I'm sorry that we had to part like this. Please don't hurt us. 
0x00000132 Well, that was unfortunate. I'm sorry it had to play out like that.
0x00000133 Man, I thought we were in this together. You were like a gestational pod-mate to me! I feel so betrayed!
0x00000134 I don't feel good about how this went down, but I guess our alliance was always tenuous at best. I'm sorry things didn't work out.
0x00000613 The Grand Council regrets your decision.
0x00000614 We're sorry that it didn't work out. We will reflect on this to see where our paths began to part.
0x00000615 Really? Is it something we said?
0x00000616 Alliance with an unbeliever was always a risk. Goodbye.
0x00000617 If data suggests that the alliance is no longer useful, then we should bring it to an end.
0x00000618 We're sorry you feel that way, but we hope you'll still visit our boutique!
0x00000619 The sage Fratfrt predicted this action in his Forty-Forth Quatrain!
0x0000061A You have acted honorably in informing us of this decision.
0x0000061B Wha...? Oh... well OF COURSE you do! You finally realized that our vast superiority to your race made for an extremely awkward alliance! In fact, we were going to break the alliance with you first, earlier this morning! We just were busy... doing... stuff.~p~Fine! We don't need your alliance anyway. It's not like you were paying any dues or anything! There are hundreds of other races out there who would *love* to be in allegiance with us. Hahaha! The Grox needs nothing! Except maybe our CDs... and that red hooded sweater you also borrowed... and maybe the lava lamp in the bedroom... but other than that, we need NOTHING!~p~Now be gone from our sight!
0x00000135 Okay, well lemme ask you something else.
0x00000136 Can I ask about something else?
0x00000137 I have another question, then.
0x00000138 There is something else I'd like to discuss.
0x00000139 These things happen. Let's not dwell.
0x0000013A Easy come. Easy go.
0x0000013B Aww, do we have to make such a big deal out of this?
0x0000013C Hey, no hard feelings. Take care.
0x0000061C The Grand Council is gratified to accept the offer of alliance.
0x0000061D The Grand Council is pleased to have a firm friend among the stars. The offer is accepted.
0x0000061E It is good to have found a kindred spirit in the Galactic Live Web. We are pleased to become your ally.
0x0000061F We accept your offer of alliance. Let us expand the Universal Life Web together!
0x00000620 Absolutely, space-buddy! As far as we're concerned, you're Numero Uno! 
0x00000621 Let's hitch our space-ships in tandem, and party till the stars die out!
0x00000622 Spode blesses the idea of an alliance.
0x00000623 We call upon Spode to witness the terms of our alliance.
0x00000624 It seems reasonable to conclude an alliance at this time. 
0x00000625 You have proven yourself worthy to become our ally. We accept your offer.
0x00000626 It has long been our wish to become an ally of your glorious self. Let the alliance prosper!
0x00000627 With this alliance, we can bring happiness to the galaxy! We accept your offer.
0x00000628 We've consulted the entrails on this matter, and now that we've washed up, we're happy to report that the entrails say yes!
0x00000629 We've cast the runes, and they say we're karmically linked!
0x0000062A You are a suitable ally. We are pleased to accept.
0x0000062B Your honorable behavior marks you out for special favor. We will be your ally.
0x0000062C We accept the offer of alliance, provided that you continue to accept our orders.
0x0000062D We shall permit you to be our ally, as long as it suits us.
0x00000141 Okay, well lemme ask you something else.
0x00000142 Can I ask about something else?
0x00000143 I have another question.
0x00000144 There is something else I'd like to discuss.
0x00000145 Yeah, I'm pumped. This is gonna be epic!
0x00000146 I'm looking forward to a long partnership.
0x00000147 Things are looking on the up and up!
0x00000148 Yesssss. Who will stop us now? Muwhahahah!
0x0000014A Hey, no offense, but we just don't know you well enough to say whether or not you can be trusted. Maybe a little quid pro quo would help. Do something for us, and we'll be a lot more likely to ally our race with your own.
0x0000014B No, it's not gonna happen. The universe has a strict pecking order, and we can't be seen with you.
0x000001A7 Let's take this slow, we barely know you.~p~We have a few tasks for you first. It will help us to better acquaint our two species.
0x000001A8 Whoa, take our foot off the hyperdrive pedal.~p~You'll need to earn our trust.
0x000001A9 Bwahahaha! You want to make an alliance? Bwahahaha!~p~Oh you're serious?~p~Let's see how serious you really are. 
0x000001AA We never party with aliens we don't know.~p~That's like party school 101.~p~Tell ya what, if you take care of a few errands for us, we might be interested.
0x000001AB In the book of Varzmir, sage of the great mountain, it is said never to enter partnership without knowing one's own partner.~p~Shall you serve Spode well, we may consider.
0x00000283 We could never enter partnership with one so uncleansed.~p~Will you seek cleansing?
0x00000550 We're sorry ~player_title~ of the ~player_creature_name~ race. We cannot enter a binding treaty with your people at this time.~p~Maybe in the future.
0x00000658 We must decline your offer ~player_title~ of the ~player_creature_name~ race.~p~We are far too busy with our experiments to enter an allegiance with you.~p~Maybe if you assist us with our studies. 
0x0000065A We are sorry, but we cannot agree to form an alliance with your great race at this time.~p~Our business has us far too busy.~p~We may reconsider if you can help us out. 
0x0000065C We appreciate the offer, but we must respectfully decline oh great one.~p~If it wouldn't be too much to ask, maybe you could assist us with a few tasks. If you're not too busy of course. 
0x0000065E It is said, ' The moon of Jodor cannot align with the planet of Vanktar 7 without the help of the Eastern Winds.'~p~Be our Eastern Winds and we may change our minds.
0x0000065F A candle without a flame cannot light a room. Before we can be your flame, we must ask that you prove yourself. 
0x00000660 You must prove yourself worthy of our respect before we enter alliance with you. 
0x00000661 The ~race~ cannot enter alliance with one who has not proven themselves honorable.~p~Prove your strength and then we can talk about forming a life bond. 
0x00000662 An alliance with The Grox?~p~You are barely worthy to be in our presence.
0x00000663 Silence! We will not talk of alliances until you have succumbed to our ways.
0x0000062E The Grand Council will be pleased to consider this matter once you have completed the mission you offered to undertake on our behalf.
0x0000062F Our records show that you have failed to complete a mission for which you volunteered. The matter of the alliance is postponed until after completion of the mission.
0x00000630 We might view this with favor... if you would complete the mission you set out to perform.
0x00000631 We recall that you had once promised to complete an assignment for us. If this task is completed, we might consider the matter of alliance.
0x00000632 Our rapidly deteriorating brain cells seem to recall that you once promised to undertake a mission for us. We can't talk about more serious matters till this mission is done!
0x00000633 Whoa, space-buddy! Not so fast! When can we expect you to complete the assignment you said you were going to perform for us?
0x00000634 Spode sees all and knows all. He will remember that you have failed to complete a mission you were to undertake on his behalf. No alliance can be contemplated until the mission is completed.
0x00000635 Your application for an alliance cannot be considered at this time. Spode's Children want only allies who keep their word. As we recall, you had offered to undertake a mission on our behalf, and this mission remains incomplete. 
0x00000636 Perhaps your memory fails you. You had offered to undertake a task on our behalf, and the task remains incomplete. We may reconsider once this mission is complete.
0x00000637 It seems irrational to accept as an ally someone who is notoriously unreliable, and who promised to perform a mission which remains incomplete.
0x00000638 We're still waiting for the profits from the mission you said you'd perform! Once that's complete, we can discuss other matters.
0x00000639 We believe in spreading happiness about the galaxy with our friends, but we're still a little depressed about that mission you said you'd perform. Finish that, and we'll talk!
0x00000149 Tell you what - you do that favor for us - the one we talked about. You do that, and we'll happily team up with you.
0x0000063A We can't possibly have an ally with bad karma, and you've brought bad karma on yourself by failing to complete an assignment for us! Finish that, and we'll consult the Seeing Stone about the alliance.
0x0000063B Sayeth the Prophet: 'Them what faileth to complete a mission will live friendless and alone.' You don't think the Prophet was talking about you, do you?
0x0000063C We would never consider an alliance with someone who will not keep his word. Didn't you promise to complete a mission for us?
0x0000063D It is impossible to speak of alliance until such time as you have completed the task you volunteered to undertake.
0x0000063E Clearly machine minds remember better than watery bags of neurons. Did you not offer to complete a mission on our behalf? Is this mission incomplete?
0x0000063F We will not ally with one whose mission is incomplete.
0x0000014C Let's talk about my mission.
0x0000014D Could you explain my mission again?
0x0000014E Let's go over my mission again.
0x0000014F Let's talk about my mission.
0x00000150 I will do what it takes to prove my worth to you.
0x00000151 I'm going to make sure whatever needs to happen, happens.
0x00000152 I'm going to make sure this alliance happens, whatever it takes.
0x00000153 What can I do to show you my commitment?
0x00000154 Man, the universe is no picnic, sometimes.
0x00000155 The universe. She is a cruel mistress.
0x00000156 That's harsh, dude. I guess I gotta do what I gotta do.

0x0000015A No missions at the moment. I think we're still pouring over the data from your last successful mission. You gave us a lot to think about!

0x0000015F Can I ask about something else?
0x00000160 I have another question, then.
0x00000161 There is something else I'd like to discuss.
0x00000162 Gimme a shout if you get any missions.
0x00000163 If anything comes up, let me know.
0x00000164 Phooey! I really wanted a new mission.
0x00000165 Let me know if I'm needed.
0x00000166 We are unable to direct you towards that goal currently. It looks like it is not possible. Please come back.
0x00000167 I have another question, then.
0x00000168 Maybe another time.
0x0000027F Captain, are you ready to continue expanding the mighty Empire of the ~player_creature_name~ race across the Galaxy?~p~There is a lot to do and a lot to learn.~p~What would you like your next mission to be?
0x00000300 Captain, it's imperative that we jumpstart our space exploration program by exploring more of the galaxy.~p~We know there are other aliens out there to make contact with. We know there are more solar systems and planets waiting to be discovered.~p~We are beginning to outgrow our homeworld of ~player_homeworld~, we should definitely see about finding other suitable planets to colonize.~p~There's so much to do. Are you ready to accept a mission?
0x00000280 I want to explore the universe.
0x00000281 I want to expand our empire.
0x00000282 I want to interact with other alien races.
0x00000284 Nothing for now.
0x00000118 Excited Scientists have created SETI device and equipped it on your spaceship. It is capable of locating other life forms living on distant planets, but you'll need to be in deep space to use it.~p~We are all fascinated that you made contact with an Alien race, albeit a deceased one, but there clearly must be more. These Grox sound interesting and perhaps a bit dangerous. We'll need to explore the riches of the galaxy and expand our empire to continue to invest in our burgeoning space program. Captain, we have many missions for you to take on for your people, colonizing, exploring, etc. What would you like to take on first?
0x00000119 I want to explore the universe.
0x0000011A I want to expand our empire.
0x0000011B I want to interact with others in the universe.
0x0000011C Nothing for now.
0x00000285 The galaxy is vast and there is much to explore. There are undiscovered planets, new life forms, and other sentient species out there just waiting for you to find them.~p~Fly to as many different planets as you can. During your journeys, you will encounter different animals, strange planets, different civilizations and discover secrets.~p~As you move forward with your exploration you will earn Badges that will unlock new tools for you to purchase. These tools will aid you in adventures.
0x00000286 I'd like to find other sentient life.
0x00000287 I'd like to hunt for artifacts.
0x00000288 I'd like to paint planets.
0x0000028A Nothing for now.
0x0000028B When it comes to expanding our empire, we have several different options.~p~We can start from scratch and build a colony on an uninhabited planet.~p~We can also set up a trade route with another empire's planet, eventually enabling you to be able to purchase their system.~p~We can always take someone else's planet by force, but that will definitely make enemies.~p~No matter how you decide to expand, it's going to take a lot of capital. The best way to make more Sporebucks is by trading Spice with other empires.~p~Colonies are great for making Spice. 
0x00000315 I'd like to colonize a planet.
0x00000316 I'd like to terraform.
0x00000317 I'd like to trade spice with others.
0x00000318 I'd like to sell artifacts to others.
0x00000319 I'd like to establish a trade route with another empire.
0x0000031A It's time to go to war with another empire.
0x0000031B Nothing for now.
0x0000031C Choose who you want as your ally or your enemy.~p~Making a friend is harder than making an enemy. You can make them happy by trading with them, giving them money or doing chores for them. If they are happy enough, they will become our ally.~p~The more allies you have, the easier it's going to be in the long run.~p~Allies offer protection, make traveling around the galaxy easier, excellent spice trading partners, a place to repair and recharge your spaceship, and a source to purchase more tools.~p~Allies will also join your fleet and fight along side you. You can expand your fleet by earning Master Badges. 
0x0000031D I'd like to find other sentient life.
0x0000031E I'd like to trade spice with others.
0x0000031F I'd like to establish a trade route with another empire.
0x00000320 It would be nice to make new allies.
0x00000321 It's time to go to war with another empire.
0x00000322 Nothing for now.
