0x00000001 An artifact hunter are you? There are plenty of interesting collectibles sprinkled throughout the galaxy waiting to be discovered and collected.~p~These artifacts are often rare and can be parts of a valuable collection or potentially sold to other Empires.~p~In addition to this precious object, we will also compensate your search with ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000007 How can I find it?
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x0000000C Ooh. Sorry. I've got a thing.
0x0000000D I can't. I'm busy.
0x00000002 You'll need to travel around the galaxy to various solar systems in order to uncover the location of rare items. When you enter a solar system, mouse over the various planets. If a planet shows a yellow signal, that planet has a rare item on it.~p~Once you're on the planet's surface, your Radar Tool will point you to the rare, if you're close enough.
0x00000022 This sounds fascinating.
0x00000029 No thanks. Not my area of expertise.
0x00000033 Congratulations! You can now sell your rare item or place it at one of your colonies as a trophy.
0x00000034 You are most welcome. Before I go...
0x0000003A Thanks! So long.
0x00000004 Still haven't tracked down a rare item? ~p~You'll need to explore many different solar systems in order to find one. They are rare after all.~p~If you're in a solar system that has one in it, carefully survey the planets, looking for a yellow signal. If there is, fly in close to planet and look around. They're always on the ground and your Radar should signal when you are near.~p~After you locate a rare artifact, you'll need to pick it up carefully with your Abduction Ray.~p~Remember, there are rare planets and other galactic objects too... but we are looking for a small rare artifact. One you can abduct into your cargo... (Good luck getting a galactic wormhole in there!)
0x0000004A Got it. One other thing...
0x0000004E My hands are full right now. Maybe later.
0x00000053 Okay! I'm off!
0x00000003 You've failed to find a rare artifact. Don't be discouraged there are many out there. 
0x00000005 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000006 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000008 Can I ask about something else?
0x00000009 One more thing...
0x0000000A Thanks! Goodbye.
0x0000000E Once you've located the rare objects on the planet's surface, use your Abduction Tool to secure the rare in your cargo bin. Once you've secured the rare, bring it back to us.~p~Good Luck and happy hunting!
0x00000018 I'd like to ask about something else...
0x0000005F Bye.
0x0000000F Not in the mood to hunt for rarities? It can be a bit addiction-forming. It starts with one, then you need to find another, and another, and then another...
0x0000006B I'd like to ask about something else...
0x00000071 Thanks. So long.
0x00000010 OK, hunting for rarities isn't your thing. No problem, let's find another mission for you.
0x00000019 I'd like to ask about something else...
0x0000007E Thanks. So long.
0x00000084 ...
0x00000085 I'm supposed to go where to get the what, now?
0x0000001A I'd like to ask about something else...
0x0000001B Ok, thanks. So long.
0x00000089 Find a rare commodity.
0x00000011 Approach the planet with the rare item.
0x00000012 Abduct the rare object.
0x00000013 Return to Home planet.
