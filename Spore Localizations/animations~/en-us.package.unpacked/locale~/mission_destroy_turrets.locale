0x00000000 This next mission requires military precision and the spirit of a true warrior.~p~There has been a military coup on planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~These new rulers are not friendly to our causes, and they must be neutralized without damage to buildings, or the citizenry.~p~We think the easiest approach would be to focus exclusively on destroying the turrets. Destroy every turret on the planet!
0x00000001 You've got a super opportunity to help a species in need.~p~Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in the grip of a Mad Emperor!~p~He's locked down every city with turrets he uses to control the populace! You need to destroy those turrets!~p~But here's the catch, buddy - you can't hurt anyone, or destroy any buildings. That would only make things worse.~p~You down?
0x00000002 We're interplanetary pen-pals with planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~We recently learned that a powerful despot has taken control of the planet and is prohibiting outbound communication and generally being a real meanie.~p~We need you to destroy all of the turrets on the planet so the populace can wrest back control.. and write us again!~p~One more thing: damage to buildings or citizens will not be tolerated.
0x00000003 Yeah, we got something you can do for us, but it's tricky business...~p~Don't go askin' questions why, but we need you to destroy all the turrets on planet ~mission_target_planet~. But ya can't do damage to buildings. Or even the citizenry.~p~This is a surgical strike.~p~Ya think you're up to it?
0x00000004 Have you seen the cities of planet ~mission_target_planet~?~p~Could a society make *worse* aesthetic decisions? Those turrets with that City Hall? I don't think so!~p~We, self-appointed Fashion Police of the Universe, will not permit this crime of architecture to stand any longer!~p~Remove... ah... destroy every turret on planet ~mission_target_planet~, so it is no longer an affront to the eye!~p~But remember - we're aestheticians, not barbarians! No unsightly damage of any other sort will be permitted!
0x00000005 Electromagnetic noise from defense turrets on ~mission_target_planet~ are interfering with our delicate instruments. We need you to disable them, completely, so we can finish our scans. The ~mission_target_empire~ don't seem to understand, but it's for their own good.
0x00000006 The covenant of the ~mission_source_empire~ guarantees our citizens freedom from tyranny. A dissident minority has seized control of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and is fortifying its cities. Will you help us suppress this revolt and liberate the citizens of ~mission_target_planet~?
0x00000007 It is the right of all sentient beings to live in peace and freedom. Yet separatists have revolted on planet ~mission_target_planet~ and have built weapons emplacements that threaten the peaceful detente of the galaxy. Would ~player_creature_name~ help us to cope with this threat?
0x00000008 A prosperous peace has long reigned throughout our civilization. Now terrorists have seized control of the defense systems of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you help us restore order?
0x00000009 Illegal gene-hackers have seized the defense web of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Our own citizens are being used as subjects for illegal experiments! Will you help save them?
0x0000000A Pirates have attacked planet ~mission_target_planet~ and seized control of the defense systems while they loot the local economy and citizens. Can you intervene?
0x0000000B A mad scientist named Garb has spread a plague among our citizens that has made them paranoid and militaristic! They've seized the defense grid of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you suppress the planet's defenses so that we can land peacekeepers and medical personnel to treat the plague's victims?
0x0000000C Worshippers of the false God That Won't Come has conspired to thwart the Will of Spode! These conspirators are persecuting the faithful on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you help to defeat the oppressors and return planet ~mission_target_planet~ to the Way of Spode?
0x0000000D Our efforts to convert the inhabitants of planet ~mission_target_planet~ were successful. But now a handful of backsliders and heretics have seized control of the world's defense grid, and are persecuting Spode's Faithful. Can you help us defeat the wicked?
0x0000000E We regret to have to admit the existence of false prophets among Spode's Faithful. A splinter group called the Sodality of Spode (Reformed) has seized control of planet ~mission_target_planet~, and are persecuting the righteous faithful! Help us crush them?
0x0000000F Members of an irrational cult who worship something called the Unknown God have attempted a coup on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Could you aid us in defeating them and restoring planet ~mission_target_planet~ to rational control?
0x00000010 A renegade artists' cooperative called the Cult Against Reason has seized power on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you help us defeat them and restore order on our world?

0x00000012 We tried to reprogram the turrets on planet ~mission_target_planet~ in order to shoot fireworks for the upcoming Festival of Hanging Out and Being Cool, but... oops!... now they're shooting at us! We're getting tired of hiding and running for our lives! Can you possibly rectify our little mistake?
0x00000013 Some totally humorless people learned about this 'militarism' philosophy from one of our neighbors, and now they've seized one of our worlds! Can you possibly give them a close shave with the laser for us?
0x00000014 We fear that the Society for Explosive Art has got a little out of hand on planet ~mission_target_planet~. They've got a hold of our defensive weaponry and now they're shooting at everything! Do you think you could give their art a well-deserved critique? 
0x00000015 The ~mission_source_empire~ is overwhelmed with frustration and anger. Some of our wretched citizens are being oppressed by the militarist species of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Great rewards would be offered to anyone who could liberate them!
0x00000016 This unworthy one is consumed with wretchedness and self-flagellation! A conspiracy of dissatisfied customers has seized control of the defenses of planet ~mission_target_planet~, and are demanding a refund! Naturally we cannot violate the sanctity of a contract in order to oblige them.~p~Would you be willing to rectify this matter on our behalf in exchange for a generous fee?
0x00000017 Alas, wickedness so pervades the universe! Industrialists seeking to enforce a high tariff have occupied the turrets of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and are threatening to lock out our cheap, customer-friendly imports! Can you help us, in return for a delightful sum?
0x00000018 We hate to be judgmental, but in our opinion the members of the Maniac Suicide Cult who seized the defense network of planet ~mission_target_planet~ have begun to push the outer limits of our tolerance. Perhaps you would agree to do a little something in order to discourage them?
0x00000019 The defenses of planet ~mission_target_planet~ have fallen into the hands of an evil entity summoned from a dark dimension. Or maybe a rogue hacker. In any case, can you rescue our citizens?
0x0000001A A group of animal rights militants have seized control of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and are holding the citizens for ransom unless we forego the eating of animal protein! This we cannot do, as we absolutely leave it to a person's conscience whether they choose to eat free-range animals raised without use of antibiotics, or to let them live a natural lifespan.~p~We shun the use of force, but yet we find that violence seems strangely attractive in this situation. Would you wield your lasers in the name of dietary freedom?
0x0000001B Violent cultists who venerate something called the Unknown God have seized the defense systems on planet ~mission_target_planet~. It would interest us greatly to discover if you can cope with this. 
0x0000001C Fanatic militarists demanding a War Against All have seized power on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The best way to pop their bubbles would be for an alien species to neutralize their defensive emplacements. Are you willing?
0x0000001D Defense computers on planet ~mission_target_planet~ have been subverted by a clever enemy. Though we could handle this situation ourselves, we would rather let our enemy know that we can call on other species to help us. Would this interest you?
0x000000BF It is necessary to make a military demonstration on planet ~mission_target_planet~. You will make this demonstration.
0x000000C0 Another race chooses to defy the Grox. You will destroy their defenses. 
0x000000C1 It is necessary for you to destroy the defense web on planet ~mission_target_planet~. You will do this at once.
0x000000C2 We've got a mission for you, Captain! It involves shooting!

0x000000C4 A cult worshiping someone called the 'Unknown God' has seized control of planet ~mission_target_planet~. We need you to help liberate them!
0x0000001E Can you tell me a little more?
0x0000001F How can I find this planet?
0x00000020 How do I get there?
0x00000021 Where are they located?
0x00000022 I never fire on things that can fire back.
0x00000023 Turrets? No way!
0x00000024 Sounds dangerous. I think I'll pass.
0x00000025 I regret that I must decline.
0x00000026 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ can be found within star system ~mission_target_star~.~p~Quelling this new shift in power early will allow us to preserve our relationship with the ~mission_target_empire~. In return, we will give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000027 Sure, buddy. With skills like yours, you'll be able to find it, no problem.~p~The planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in star system ~mission_target_star~.~p~And buddy, you're so lucky, we're even gonna pay you for your good deed! How does ~mission_rewards~ Spucks sound?~p~Now, up and at those turrets, tiger!
0x00000028 Oh, sorry! Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in star system ~mission_target_star~. Finding it should be straightforward.~p~In exchange, we'll give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~Oh, I can't wait to resume writing my ~mission_target_planet~ pen-pal. What a dialogue we shared! I can't wait to publish the collection. Well, they were a bit ribald. A tad bawdy. Slightly haughty. A little naughty. In short, every one a party!~p~Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
0x00000029 What? Like ya ain't got all kindsa fancy gear in your spaceship to tell you how to get there? Well, whatever. Here:~p~Planet ~mission_target_planet~ orbits a ball'o'gas in the ~mission_target_star~ system. You can't miss it.~p~In return, you'll get ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.~p~Ya interested?
0x0000002A You can locate these gauche and classless fashion criminals on the planet ~mission_target_planet~, which orbits the plane of the ecliptic of a celestial body in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~If you aid us in peaceably eradicating these fashion monstrosities from this arm of the galaxy, we would by forever grateful to you.~p~Additionally, we can tender you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks as remuneration~p~Is this something that would interest you, perchance?.
0x0000002B MISSION PLANETARY BODY: Planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~STAR SYSTEM: ~mission_target_star~.~p~PAYMENT: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~PURPOSE: Remove EM noise to resume ongoing surface telemetry.
0x0000002C Travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and destroy the turrets so that our peacekeepers can land and restore order. 
0x0000002D Spode's children could live joyously if the turrets of their oppressors on planet ~mission_target_planet~ were destroyed. Let the holy fire cleanse planet ~mission_target_planet~! Time is crucial, so leave at once! 
0x0000002E The violent dissidents are crewing defense turrets on all major cities of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Travel to the ~mission_target_star~ system, locate planet ~mission_target_planet~, and destroy all turrets so that our peacekeeping forces can be landed. Do not endanger peaceful citizens during your strike. 
0x0000002F The cultists have seized control of the planet's defense system. Destroy the turrets of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Do not harm other buildings or innocent civilians.
0x00000030 Blowing up the turrets should suffice to bring these unfortunates to their senses. Whatever you do, don't blow up anything else, and don't kill any of the people you see screaming and running for cover. Because, you know, that's just too easy.
0x00000031 The beings of ~mission_source_empire~ could live free if the turrets of our oppressors on planet ~mission_target_planet~ were destroyed. Alas, we are a peaceful species and cannot do this for ourselves. 
0x00000032 To go planet ~mission_target_planet~, in star system ~mission_target_star~, and destroy all turrets, after which the victims of this tragedy can begin to achieve closure.
0x00000033 Those who depend on a static defense are like those who build a wall of straw to keep out the ocean...~p~Demonstrate this principle by destroying the turrets of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Do not harm other buildings or loyal civilians. 
0x000000C5 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in orbit in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Destroy all turrets. Do not harm other buildings or our future slaves. 
0x000000C6 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ orbits the ~mission_target_star~ system. In order to help the people against their oppressors, you must destroy all the turrets. Don't damage buildings or the population. 
0x00000034 Okay, got it. I'll take care of 'em.
0x00000035 Well. I've got things to blow up...
0x00000036 I guess I'll be on my way...
0x00000037 Okay, I'm off
0x00000038 That sounds like a haul. I pass.
0x00000039 I respectfully decline.
0x0000003A No, thank you. I'm not interested.
0x0000003B Nope. I think you should find someone else.
0x0000003C Well done! We knew we had to put our top fly-jockey on this mission. Here's your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, as advertised.~p~I'm glad my instincts about you were right! I'm sure to get a promotion for this!~p~The citizens of planet ~mission_target_planet~ are now free to pursue a form of governance more to our liking.~p~Hooray! Freedom marches on!
0x0000003D Wow oh wow, buddy! That was some precision maneuvering there!~p~You really worked for those ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Enjoy it with our thanks, buddy.~p~And now that you've defeated the Mad Emperor, we can open up a Free Trade Agreement with the newly liberated citizens of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Let the flow of goods and services commence!
0x0000003E Oh, I can't wait to resume my correspondence with Goolp, and I'm sure the rest of us are just as happy to have our planet ~mission_target_planet~ pen-pals back, as well!~p~Here's your reward, as promised: ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Really, we can't thank you enough.~p~Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to start composing a lengthy letter to my dear old Goolp.
0x0000003F Oh, ~player_creature_name~, thank you! Here are your ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.~p~With those turrets gone, our teensy-weensy-widdle-snugglepuss, Mr. Giggles, is safe!~p~Ach! Did I just say that out loud!?! You weren't supposed to find out about Mr. Giggles, our pet mini-Oogie. We love the little guy so much!~p~*Sniff*~p~The ~mission_target_empire~ captured him, but now that you've safely disabled their defenses, we can get Mr. Giggles back.~p~And then planet ~mission_target_planet~ will reap a terrible whirlwind!
0x00000040 Such wondrous news! Here is your compensation - ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, just as promised.~p~It's always so satisfying to bring a sense of style to a world so clearly lacking in taste and refined sensibilities.~p~The Fashion Police have done good work here today. We all have.~p~Now, onto other matters: About that spaceship you're flying...
0x00000041 MISSION STATUS: Successfully completed by Contractor.~p~PAYMENT: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~STATEMENT OF SATISFACTION: Sweet work, buddy. We should do lunch sometime.
0x00000042 Congratulations! The Grand Council has authorized me to offer you a Certificate of Commendation, First Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x00000043 Your efforts to protect our people are recognized. Please enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. 
0x00000044 Truly Spode has delivered his children from the demonic God That Won't Come! Verily, you have earned your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. And if you have a moment, a missionary would very much like to speak with you.
0x00000045 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been returned to rational government. You have our thanks. In order to motivate you in the direction of further cooperation, we offer ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000046 The wreckage you leave behind has a certain austere pathos that we find quite moving! For this alone, we give you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. 
0x00000047 Delight suffuses my very being! Please gaze upon the glory of your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x00000048 You've restored a rosy glow to the auras of the people on planet ~mission_target_planet~. In order to partially compensate you for the trauma of employing violence, we offer you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x00000049 You have succeeded in suppressing our enemies. Your proficiency has been noted. As you are motivated by material rewards as well as honor, we offer you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x000000C7 ~player_creature_name~. Your military capabilities proved sufficient. In order to motivate further cooperation, we offer ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. 
0x000000C8 Excellent shooting, Captain! We're happy to offer you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000004A One other thing before I go...
0x0000004B I'd like to speak to you about something else...
0x0000004C Can I ask you one more thing?
0x0000004D One more thing. Sorry to be a bother...
0x0000004E That was fun. Thanks.
0x0000004F I always enjoy destruction. Thanks.
0x00000050 Always a pleasure...
0x00000051 Take care, now.
0x00000052 Forgetfulness? We expected more from you...~p~Pay attention: Destroy every turret on planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~BUT - Do not destroy *any* buildings. Do not kill *any* citizens.~p~Freedom is on the march. We can't afford any PR debacles!
0x00000053 Buddy? What're ya doin' here, huh?~p~Our conquest...~p~Errrr... I mean, our fight to end the Mad Emperor's reign of terror must happen quickly, buddy. Tick tock.~p~Here's what you do:~p~Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Destroy all the turrets, without doing damage to other buildings, and without hurting anybody. Simple. Piece o' cake!
0x00000054 You're back! Have you seen Goolp? No?~p~Oh, I'm so crestfallen! I thought you had already flown to the ~mission_target_star~ system and destroyed every turret on planet ~mission_target_planet~ without damaging *any* buildings, or harming *anyone*.~p~Anyone, like my dear old pen-pal, Goolp. I would be so devastated if anything were to happen to Goolp. Oh, Goolp. I miss you!
0x00000055 What're ya doin' here, ya big lout?!~p~You're supposed to be out saving Mr. Giggles! ~p~I mean... ehhh...~p~You need to destroy every turret on planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ star system.~p~This next part is important: Do not destroy *any* other buildings, and especially, don't harm *anyone*!~p~Why? Mind your business!
0x00000056 Now listen! The Fashion Police command it!~p~Go to star system ~mission_target_star~ and destroy every turret you find on planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~But remember: We just want to use overwhelming force to right their crimes of poor taste - those turrets with that City Hall. It's appalling!~p~We don't want to harm them - no damage to buildings or the citizenry, please.
0x00000057 MISSION STATUS: Ongoing; Contractor requires reiteration of factual information.~p~MISSION OVERVIEW: Destroy turrets on planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS: Do not destroy other buildings. Do not kill citizens!
0x00000058 The Grand Council has heard the anguished cries of its citizens as they lament your failure to act. The ~player_creature_name~ have already agreed to this mission, as verified by the instructions in your Mission Log. Will you complete it?
0x00000059 Our citizens are still in danger on planet ~mission_target_planet~! All the details are in your Mission Log. Will you travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and liberate them?
0x0000005A Wherefore do you leave uncompleted the liberation of planet ~mission_target_planet~? Your commitment is plainly visible in your Mission Log! Will you honor your word?
0x0000005B Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is still in the command of cultists who still are crewing the defense systems. Will you travel to star system ~mission_target_star~ and destroy the turrets? All relevant information is available in your Mission Log. 
0x0000005C We're really not into being the group memory for the galaxy, so we hate to remind you about your agreement to blow up the turrets on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Check your Mission Log if you doubt us!
0x0000005D We hear the lamentations of our friends on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you complete their liberation? All necessary information should have been loaded in your Mission Log.
0x0000005E We realize the task is difficult, but peace has still not been achieved on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you help us? All the information should be in your Mission Log.
0x0000005F The defenses of planet ~mission_target_planet~ are still subverted. You are honor-bound to cope with this, as witnessed by your Mission Log. We expect you to return victorious, or to see your ship blown to pieces on the strand. 
0x000000C9 The defense grid of planet ~mission_target_planet~ has not been suppressed. All relevant information is available in your Mission Log. Destroy all turrets.
0x000000CA We see that the defense grid of planet ~mission_target_planet~ hasn't been destroyed! You need to help the people by destroying the turrets. All information is available in your Mission Log. 
0x00000060 Okay. Real quick. One more thing...
0x00000061 I'd like to discuss something else.
0x00000062 Can I ask you something?
0x00000063 I have another question.
0x00000064 I quit. This mission is hard.
0x00000065 This assignment just isn't working out.
0x00000066 I think I'm done. Yup. I quit.
0x00000067 I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000068 Right. Be back in jiff.
0x00000069 Ahh. I see. Okay.
0x0000006A Got it. Thanks.
0x0000006B Okay. I'm off to blow stuff up.
0x0000006C We're sure you had the best of intentions, but you've unwittingly created an intergalactic crisis!~p~The whole point was to remove this rogue government, while leaving structures and civilians intact.~p~No matter how fun and satisfying it may be, you just can't go around blowing things up willy-nilly!~p~Well, not on the clock anyway.
0x0000006D Awww, buddy. We can't abide wanton destruction.~p~We asked you very politely to please not destroy buildings or citizens.~p~It wasn't a request, slick. We weren't kidding.~p~This whole Mad Emperor situation is a ticking time bomb. Gears within gears, buddy.~p~We're extremely disappointed in you, buddy.
0x0000006E Oh, no! Oh, Goolp!~p~Why, if I wasn't a pacifist with joint problems and hemophilia, I'd really show you what for.~p~If your disregard for the safety of others has harmed Goolp in any way, I'll... I'll...~p~*SOB*~p~Oh, Goolp!
0x0000006F WHAT!!! HOW DARE YOU DEFY OUR ORDERS!!!~p~Mr. Giggles, our beloved widdle, iddle, itty-bitty mini-Oogie was being held hostage by the ~mission_target_empire~!~p~If you've harmed Mr. Giggles in any way...~p~WE SHALL DEVOUR YOUR FLESH!!!~p~But you're lucky. There's no time for petty vengeance. Not when Mr. Giggles could be in harm's way. We must redirect all our efforts to finding him!!!~p~BEGONE!!!
0x00000070 Oh, joy, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~Your careless disregard for our instructions has taken us from the realm of fashion disaster, and cast us rudely into the domain of an *actual* catastrophe. We do hope you're happy.
0x00000071 MISSION STATUS: Failed.~p~REASONING/OTHER: Contractor caused superfluous damage to structures or personnel.~p~CONTRACTOR STATUS: Disfavor.
0x00000072 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We share your chagrin at the failure of this difficult mission. In compensation for your inconvenience, the Grand Council has authorized me to offer you a Certificate of Commendation, Second Class.
0x00000073 You inflicted wanton destruction on our world! We have no more time for you... we must rebuild, and mourn our dead. Goodbye. 
0x00000074 Alas that Spode's hand did not guide you! The planet was not liberated in time to prevent grave oppression of our people. In Spode's own time we shall avenge our martyrs. 
0x00000075 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Data from planet ~mission_target_planet~ suggests that your weapons are not as powerful as we suspected. We shall return the planet to rational control ourselves. 
0x00000076 Though we appreciate your stern vigor, we really think you carry it too far. You blew up all the wrong things, and we weren't planning on redecorating this year.
0x00000077 Your use of weapons was overly enthusiastic! Many are our wailings at the destruction you have caused.
0x00000078 My goodness! ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You caused massive destruction on our world! Now we'll have to hold a non-denominational mourning ceremony. Perhaps it wouldn't be tactful for you to attend.
0x00000079 Your indiscriminate firing indicates poor fire control, if not complete panic. You are invited to leave our security zone.
0x000000CB Your fire control is poorly managed and has caused unnecessary destruction. We will correct for this tendency in the future.
0x0000007A Drat. Well, let me ask you something else.
0x0000007B Dag. Well, I have another question.
0x0000007C Frak! Well, I'd like to discuss something.
0x0000007D Shazbot! Oh well...
0x0000007E The glare of their star interfered with my aim.
0x0000007F I had an off day. My bad.
0x00000080 My heart just wasn't in it, I guess.
0x00000081 You have my most sincere apologies.
0x00000082 You failed to destroy the turrets on time. Pity.
0x000000CC We appreciate your efforts on our behalf. We'll have to mobilize our own forces to deal with this crisis.
0x000000CD Data from planet ~mission_target_planet~ suggests that your weapons are not as powerful as we suspected. We shall return the planet to rational control ourselves. 
0x000000CE We share your chagrin at the failure of this difficult mission. In compensation for your inconvenience, the Grand Council has authorized me to offer you a Certificate of Commendation, Second Class.
0x00000083 We had our eyes on the scoreboard the whole time, and you didn't blow up the turrets before the buzzer! Better luck next time. 
0x00000084 Woe is the ~mission_source_empire~! Yet despite the oppression of our kinfolk, we will nevertheless allow you to visit our bazaar. 
0x00000085 You failed to rescue our people in time! We thank you for trying, but we think that perhaps if you took up meditation you'd be better at clearing your mind for the business at hand.
0x00000086 You have failed to suppress our enemies in the time allotted. We will finish the job ourselves... and unlike you, we shall not dawdle. 
0x000000CF You didn't manage to destroy the turrets quickly enough, Captain! You can stop shooting now. 
0x000000D0 You have exceeded the time necessary for your mission on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Your capabilities are insufficient. 
0x00000087 I'm sorry. Can we discuss something else...
0x00000088 Yes, there were complications...
0x0000009B This wasn't my best work...
0x0000009C Let's focus on the future...
0x0000009D I need to move on. Farewell.
0x0000009E I beg your understanding.
0x00000089 Excellent. We knew we could count on you.~p~Report back here as soon as you're done, so we can let the Galaxy know that a great and important mission has been accomplished.~p~You'll also get your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. But remember: You only have ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to destroy all turrets.
0x0000008A That is just super-duper-fanastico, amigo!~p~You're doing a great thing here. Helping out a people in need.~p~You go show The Mad Emperor that his shenanigans aren't appreciated. Not in this Galaxy.~p~You do that, buddy.
0x0000008B We knew eventually we'd find someone who would help us. Thank you! Thank you!~p~And if you happen to see my pen-pal, Goolp, tell Goolp that I've missed our letters terribly during this ordeal.~p~But don't spend too much time seeking my correspondent. You only have ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to destroy all turrets.
0x0000008C Heh heh heh. That's great, pal. We know we can count on you!~p~Just make sure you remember: No damage! No buildings. No civilians. No plants. No animals. And, with only ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to destroy all turrets, you'd best act fast. And don't miss!
0x0000008D You have brought joy to our hearts, knowing that this fashion emergency will be dealt with swiftly and severely! Thank you!~p~Now be off! Let the solar winds spirit you to your destination. Keep your weapons to their true to your intended targets. Paparazzi will be on hand to catch you in action. Quick! You have only ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to destroy those hideous turrets. 
0x0000008E MISSION STATUS: Accepted by Contractor. In progress.~p~WORDS OF AFFIRMATION: Thanks, buddy.~p~WORDS OF FAREWELL: Once on planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have only ~mission_time~ sectons to destroy all turrets. See ya!
0x0000008F The Grand Council thanks you. Please travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ where you will have ~mission_time~ sectons to destroy all turrets.
0x00000090 ~player_creature_name~ has shown itself a true friend of civilization. Travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ where you'll only have ~mission_time~ sectons to liberate its citizens by destroying all turrets. 
0x00000091 May peace and prosperity reward you. Travel at once to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy all turrets. If you fail, please try to maintain a plausible deniability.
0x00000092 This action will earn our gratitude. Please travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and smash the turrets. Do so within ~mission_time~ sectons to prevent the enemy from becoming entrenched. 
0x00000093 Travel at once to planet ~mission_target_planet~, in star system ~mission_target_star~, where you will have ~mission_time~ sectons to smite all turrets! Be careful not to hurt any of the Faithful of Spode!
0x00000094 Once the turrets of planet ~mission_target_planet~ are destroyed, religious orthodoxy shall prevail! Travel immediately to the ~mission_target_star~ system, where you'll have ~mission_time~ sectons to cleanse the turrets with holy fire! Be sure not to injure any of Spode's faithful children. 
0x00000095 The wicked shelter in the turrets on planet ~mission_target_planet~ and dare to shoot at Spode's faithful. Travel to star system ~mission_target_star~, where you'll have ~mission_time~ sectons to destroy the turrets, and open the planet to the Light of Spode! Let not any of Spode's holy followers be cleansed by accident. 
0x00000096 Thank you. Travel at once to planet ~mission_target_planet~, which is in orbit in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and destroy all turrets. Attack quickly, before time runs out!
0x00000097 Have we mentioned how very much we like your take-no-prisoners personal style? Head for planet ~mission_target_planet~, which is orbiting in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and blow up every turret you see! And do so within ~mission_time~ sectons, before things get really out of hand!
0x00000098 We are struck with awe at your decisiveness and martial ability! Please travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~, which is in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and destroy all turrets. Once there, you have ~mission_time~ sectons to turn them all into smoking ruin!~p~On no account harm any of our citizens, or their property. 
0x00000099 Thank you. You have ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to destroy all turrets. Please don't damage innocent people, plants, or animals in the course of your actions. Hurry, before the situation grows worse!
0x0000009A Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~, which is part of star system ~mission_target_star~, and destroy all turrets within the allotted ~mission_time~ sectons. We appreciate efficiency, so you will go quickly if you want to retain our esteem.
0x000000D1 The mission is time-critical, so leave at once. You have ~mission_time~ sectons to travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy all turrets.
0x000000D2 Quickly, Captain! We're depending on you! Once on planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have only ~mission_time~ sectons to destroy all turrets.
0x00000112 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000113 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000114 Also...
0x00000115 One more thing...
0x00000116 I should be off. Farewell!
0x00000117 Thank you for the opportunity. So long.
0x00000118 I will return shortly. So long.
0x00000119 The task is at hand. Farewell.
0x0000009F Oh.~p~We weren't counting on this reaction from you.~p~Our staff psychiatrists assured us you were the right being for the job.~p~It's such a shame to see you opposing freedom like this. And now of all times, when it's on the march! For shame!
0x000000D3 Defiance of the Grox is where this whole problem began.
0x000000A0 Ohhh, buddy. This is suuuuch a bummer, guy.~p~Is it because you're afraid of the Mad Emperor? Is it?~p~Don't worry. It's okay. He's a very imposing fellow. He is a bit mad, after all.~p~It's a common reaction, but we're disappointed all the same.
0x000000A1 Oh, this is terrible. What a crushing disappointment!~p~Poor Goolp! It's so hard - not knowing what dear old Goolp is up to. We've been friends and pen-pals for so long now...~p~Oh, Goolp! 
0x000000A2 Bah! You useless sack of meat!~p~We go through alla that trouble, telling you about this mission that so badly needs doin', and you refuse us? Just like that?~p~You'd best be leaving quickly, if you know what's good for you.~p~Well? Do you?
0x000000A3 No, you say?~p~Oh, then why the bother of explaining the criminal trespasses of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and its citizens, hmmm?~p~Do you make a mockery of our ever-judgmental ways? Do you make light of... The Fashion Police!?!
0x000000A4 MISSION STATUS: Contract unfulfilled. Refused by Contractor.~p~CONTRACTOR STATUS: No Longer Preferred. Replacement sought.
0x000000A5 The Grand Council will not compel any species to employ violence against its will. May peace attend you.
0x000000A6 We shudder at the creations these criminals will unleash. Goodbye. 
0x000000A7 Our martyrs shall speak against you from the grave! May Spode's love follow you to an untimely death. Farewell.
0x000000A8 We comprehend your reluctance. Our own security forces shall deal with the matter.
0x000000A9 You won't help us? But our turrets are just dying for the kiss of your lasers! 
0x000000AA Alas, our poor wretched citizens! Our species shall go into mourning at once. Goodbye. 
0x000000AB If you want to give peace a chance, we understand. 
0x000000AC We had not realized you were so militarily weak.
0x000000D4 You won't help? Really?
0x000000AF I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000B0 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x000000B1 Also...
0x000000B2 One more thing...
0x000000B3 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000B4 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000D7 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000E0 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x000000E1 I beg your understanding.
0x000000B5 You're lucky we don't consider this an obstruction of justice!~p~It's one thing to refuse this mission, but to walk away from it in the middle is unacceptable. You're depriving the people of planet ~mission_target_planet~ of the freedom they can't, and haven't, even asked us to provide for them.~p~Shame! Shame on you! SHAME!!! 
0x000000B6 Oh, buddy. Buddy buddy buddy buddy.~p~You've really let us down, buddy. You know?~p~I mean, all this time you've been busy *not* blowing up turrets is time that some other contractor could have spent *blowing* up turrets. You know?~p~We'd really hoped for more from you, buddy.
0x000000B7 Oh! I would never question your obviously superior judgment in these matters, but wouldn't it be better if you, you know, carried out the mission?~p~I don't know. I'm just saying, is all. Never mind.~p~I guess now I'll never hear from Goolp again...~p~*Sigh*!~p~Oh, Goolp!
0x000000B8 HOW DARE YOU WALK AWAY FROM THIS MISSION!!!~p~It's just... well, this is a really, really super-important mission to us.~p~AND YOU'VE BEEN WASTING VALUABLE TIME!!!! WE SHOULD BLOW YOUR SHIP FROM THE SKIES!!!~p~But we need to find another suitable sharp-shooter, and quickly!~p~This mission. There was more to it than you knew.~p~Oh, Mr. Giggles!~p~*Sob!!!*
0x000000B9 Terrible press. Have you seen it? You have egregiously wronged The Fashion Police! We shan't forget this!~p~And here's another thing we also won't soon forget: your reckless disregard for even basic accessories!~p~The Fashion Police may decide to pursue this matter. We'll be in touch.
0x000000BA MISSION STATUS: Contract unfulfilled. Refused by Contractor.~p~CONTRACTOR STATUS: No Longer Preferred. Drop from future contract consideration.
0x000000BB Many of our citizens will die due to this refusal on your part. You are an enemy of civilization. Goodbye.
0x000000BC You're giving up in the face of this heinous crime? Goodbye.
0x000000BD Long is the reach of Spode's vengeance. Goodbye.
0x000000BE Such irrational actions rarely produce satisfactory results. Goodbye.
0x000000F0 Are you intentionally random, or do you have no method at all? Goodbye.
0x000000F1 My feeble mind cannot comprehend your refusal to complete your mission. I shall sequester myself until understanding dawns. Goodbye.
0x000000F2 You won't rescue our people? We'll have to send healing energy instead.
0x000000F3 You tempt us to violent action.
0x000000D5 Seldom have we seen a species so insistent on its own extinction.
0x000000D6 You're giving up? Why did we give you a laser in the first place?
0x000000E2 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000F4 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x000000F5 Also...
0x000000F6 One more thing...
0x000000F7 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000F9 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000FA I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000FB I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x000000FC I beg your understanding. 
0x000000F8 ...
0x000000FD I need a little refresher on the mission...
0x000000FE Uhh... What am I supposed to do again?
0x000000FF I spaced on my mission. What is it again?
0x00000100 I forgot what I doing. What's my mission?
0x000000AD Can you remind me of my mission?
0x000000AE Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!
0x00000101 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000102 Also...
0x00000109 One more thing...
0x0000010A I'd rather do something else.
0x0000010B I need to decline this task.
0x0000010C This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x0000010D I beg to be released from this task.
0x0000010E Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x0000010F Until we speak again. So long.
0x00000110 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x00000111 I beg your understanding.
