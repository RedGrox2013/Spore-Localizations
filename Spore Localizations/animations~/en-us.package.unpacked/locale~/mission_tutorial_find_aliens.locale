0x00000001 Captain, we have intercepted transmissions that we believe are coming from other advanced beings in the galaxy! We need you to investigate and attempt to establish first contact.~p~Use the SETI tool, equipped on your ship, to help find them.~p~Will you accept this most important mission?
0x00000002 Of course. How will I speak to them?
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x0000000C Ooh. Sorry. I've got a thing.
0x0000000D I can't. I'm busy.
0x00000016 Your Short-Range Communicator is equipped with a universal translator, that will aid in communicating with any alien races you might encounter.~p~You'll need to travel within their solar system to communicate with them.
0x00000017 Great! Where do I find these aliens?
0x0000001A We haven't been able to pinpoint the exact location of these transmissions, so you will need to explore a bit.~p~After reaching interstellar space, target stars that trigger a response from your SETI tool. Radio lines and audio signals are a clear indication.
0x0000001C How will I know when to come back?
0x00000023 Space flight will cause wear and tear on your ship. Return home for repairing and recharging your ship when needed, or to check in with Mission Control on other space program assignments.
0x00000006 I think I've got it.
0x0000003B We will await your report once you have established contact with the aliens.~p~Good luck in your search!
0x0000003C Understood. Bye
0x0000000F Sure thing, Captain. It is your ship.~p~We can discuss this mission later.
0x00000098 I would like to ask something else...
0x00000071 I'm off to explore! So long.
0x0000005D ...
0x0000005E I forgot what I was doing...
0x0000005F What am I supposed to do again?
0x00000060 I'm on a caper, but what is it again?
0x00000061 Can you remind me of my assignment?
0x0000002F We are picking up static which indicates another space faring species is out here with us. Find them and open communications.~p~You will know they are space faring by the Galaxy icon on the planet information.~p~This information has been recorded in your Mission Log.
0x0000000A Also...
0x00000007 Before I go...
0x00000008 One other thing...
0x00000009 I will do this later. Dropping it for now...
0x00000024 Understood. Bye
0x00000025 Got it. See ya.
0x00000033 Will do! Take it easy!
0x00000035 I see. I'll be back soon.
0x00000044 No problem, Captain.~p~Let us know if we can assist you in some way.
0x0000000E Also...
0x00000026 Before I go...
0x00000027 One other thing...
0x00000045 I'm off to explore! So long.
0x0000002A The download from your data recorder is quite amazing, Captain! We had no idea other space faring Civilizations were so close by.~p~We are well on our way to establishing our place in the Galactic Community!~p~It is probably a good idea to forge a good relationship with this race. We may need an ally in the future.~p~Taking assignments from them will hopefully keep us in their good graces. They may also be interested in trade, which would be a great boost to our Empire's wealth.~p~Are you ready to take on more missions?
0x0000002C I'm in.
0x00000010 Thanks. I can't wait to explore more! So long.
