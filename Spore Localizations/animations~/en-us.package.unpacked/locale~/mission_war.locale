0x00000000 We have been trying to peacefully negotiate with the ~mission_target_empire~ in secret for some time now, but all our efforts have proven unsuccessful. These bellicose upstarts have left us with little choice. Regrettably, we must send them a message they wont fail to understand. Go to ~mission_target_planet~, a small colony of the ~mission_target_empire~, and destroy or capture all the cities you find there.
0x00000001 Listen, I'm only telling you this 'cause you know I love ya, right? The ~mission_target_empire~ were totally talking smack about you. Terrible things were said, buddy. Your mom was mentioned. More than once.~p~I would never tell you what to do, but if I was you, I'd go straight to ~mission_target_planet~, and I'd destroy or capture every city I saw! This is about the future of the galactic economy!
0x00000002 Oh, my stars! Please! Help us! We beg of you! The ~mission_target_empire~, won't leave us be! They're threatening to stuff our planet into a gigantic locker if we don't give them our lunch money.~p~We have low blood sugar - we need lunch! Please! You must deal with these bullies! Destroy or capture every city on planet ~mission_target_planet~. It seems drastic, but it's the only way they'll learn.
0x00000003 The ~mission_target_empire~ thinks it's soooooo great. Primpin' and preenin' like they own the universe! Dagnabbit! That will not stand!~p~It's about time they was knocked down to size, hmmmm? Tell ya what? Go to ~mission_target_planet~ and lay waste to every city there. We'll make it worth your while for giving those whippersnappers their comeuppance!
0x00000004 Alas! Is it, perchance, a savior, sent by the very heavens to save us from our wretched destiny?~p~The ~mission_target_empire~ have set all manner of fell beast upon us. Their attacks are merciless! Our people teeter on the precipice!~p~We beseech you with utmost humility: set out for ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture every metropolis you find there. Only then will we be freed from their tyrannical oppression!
0x00000005 MISSION REQUEST: Planetary downsizing event required on ~mission_target_planet~.~p~MISSION TARGET: ~mission_target_empire~.~p~MISSION SPECIFICS: Destroy or capture all metropolitan areas.~p~REASONING/OTHER: They know what they did!~p~QUERY: Do you accept mission parameters?
0x00000006 A fundamental right of all citizens is to be free from violence and fear. Yet the inhabitants of ~mission_target_planet~ have militarized their society and now constitute a threat not only to our civilization, but to the peace of the galaxy.~p~Will you stand with us against this menace?
0x00000007 Another species has killed our peaceful diplomatic mission and attacked our planets. As it is a principle of our civilization to remain free from violence, we are mobilizing against the enemy. In the meantime, however, can you do your part?
0x00000008 The Grand Council desires all species to live in harmony. Nevertheless, another race has attacked our worlds. While we battle them on our home ground, it appears that one of their worlds is undefended. Will you help us bring the war to the enemy?
0x00000009 Despite our best efforts to live in peace with our neighbors, we're being attacked by a life-hating civilization. Can you help us defend ourselves from this menace? 
0x0000000A A vicious alien race has attacked our civilization! While our forces devote themselves to protecting our fragile planetary balance, can you lead the counter-attack on one of their home worlds?
0x0000000B A peaceful exploration party has been massacred by an alien civilization. Will you help us fight these aggressors?
0x0000000C Another species defies the Way of Spode by refusing our generous offer of conversion! These vile and wretched beings defy us!~p~The Will of Spode demands that these beings be reduced to their constituent atoms! Will you join us in making war on these perverse creatures? 
0x0000000D Our efforts to convert a certain world to the Way of Spode has met with unanticipated resistance. Will you help us?
0x0000000E Diabolical forces have tricked the forces of another civilization into declaring war on the Worlds of Spode!  Will you help us crush them?
0x0000000F The Will of Spode demands that these beings be reduced to their constituent atoms! Will you join us in making war on these perverse creatures?
0x00000010 The ~mission_target_empire~ has declared war on us and massacred a scientific research team. This treacherous behavior has caught us by surprise. Would you help us defend ourselves against this menace?
0x00000011 We have been subjected to a vicious raid by the expansionist ~mission_target_empire~. If we fall to the enemy, you'll be next on their list! Can we count on your aid?
0x00000012 The military forces of the ~mission_target_empire~ are fully engaged with our own fleet. This leaves an opportunity for our friends to smash one of their worlds! Will you help us win this decisive victory?
0x00000013 We're being attacked by a very tedious species that's interested only in terror and violence. The monotony of it all is driving us mad!~p~Perhaps beings of your vitality and simple martial virtue can be of service to us. What do you say?
0x00000014 If there's anything calculated to ruin a Festival of Visual Delights, it's a bunch of alien warmongers with laser cannons and bombs! We hate to be inhospitable, but they keep blowing up our prettiest things!~p~Can you help us to convince these party-crashers to go home?
0x00000015 Here we were, minding our own business, and suddenly a militarist species appeared in our skies and started lobbing high explosives at us! Could you possibly pop over to one of their worlds and give them a taste of their own medicine?
0x00000016 The ~mission_source_empire~ are a peaceful nation, yet we find ourselves in the position of being attacked by another species! We beg your aid in helping us to defend ourselves from these violent and tyrannical race. Enormous rewards may be anticipated by anyone agreeing to be our friend.
0x00000017 Behold the most wretched and unhappy of beings! Our worlds are being attacked by an aggressor species, and it is all we can do to defend ourselves!~p~If our noble and heroic friends, however, were to attack the enemy in their home systems, we would offer them compensation equal to their greatness!
0x00000018 The ~mission_source_empire~ desire only to bring happiness to the galaxy, but those who oppose this noble goal will stop at nothing to prevent us! We are being attacked by another species!~p~We know that this loathsome empire would crumble before your magnificence if you were only to bestir yourselves. Perhaps the offer of rewards would tempt you?
0x00000019 We were explaining the virtues of aura balancing and cleansing to an alien species, and suddenly they began to attack us!~p~Though we deplore violence, we feel that the karmic balance should nevertheless be restored. What do you think?
0x0000001A An alien species is attacking our worlds! We keep sending them peaceful vibrations, but it's not working!~p~Perhaps you can introduce them to the law of equal and opposite reaction? 
0x0000001B We keep trying to negotiate with this new species we discovered, but every time we try to talk to them, they start shooting!~p~Perhaps you could show them that there are two sides to this 'shooting' business?
0x0000001C The ~mission_target_empire~ has foolishly declared war on us. While we engage and destroy their invading fleets, perhaps it might amuse you to attack their lightly-defended home worlds?
0x0000001D The surest way of killing a snake is to strike at the head. We are at war with the ~mission_target_empire~ and have discovered a lightly defended enemy world. Bring us their heads on a platter!
0x0000001E We are engaged in a victorious war against the ~mission_target_empire~. Would you care to rise in our esteem by helping us to crush them?
0x00000178 We are at war with the ~mission_target_empire~. We require you to attack them at ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000179 You will attack ~mission_target_planet~ immediately.
0x0000017A We desire an evaluation of your military capabilities. You will provide it.
0x0000017B We're at war with the ~mission_target_empire~! Now is the time to strike! 
0x0000017C Captain, now is the time to bring the war to the enemy! Attack ~mission_target_planet~!
0x0000017D It's time to teach the aggressive ~mission_target_empire~ a lesson! 
0x0000001F How do I find these ruffians?
0x00000020 Tell me where I can find these scallywags!
0x00000021 How do I find these curs?
0x00000022 Where can I find them?
0x00000023 What you propose is monstrous. I'll have no part.
0x00000024 Never. I won't participate in this travesty!
0x00000025 Nuh uh. Do it yourself. I don't wanna.
0x00000026 Kill them yourself.
0x000000EA I must regretfully decline
0x00000027 We knew we could count on you! ~mission_target_planet~ can be found within the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~We know you must find this to be a terrible burden to bear, to say nothing of the ethical implications alone! However, if you complete this grave task successfully, we'll give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000028 Excellent. So, go to ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and show those nerfy-lookin' scruffherders that they can't talk about my mom that way! I mean, your mom! *Sigh* Just do it. We'll pay. How's ~mission_rewards~ Spucks sound?
0x00000029 Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! We'd do it ourselves, but we're just not suited for warfare. Hemophilia runs rampant throughout our gene pool, and our motor skills could be better.~p~Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and wipe the cities clean of those bullies for ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x0000002A Yeah! That's the fightin' spirit! Have at 'em! Get fired up!~p~You got that fire in your belly? Are you urgin' for a purgin'? Then, quick! Head to ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and lay waste to their cities. Lay waste real good now. I don't want to hear tales o' no survivors. Do that, and we'll will give you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x0000002B Hep Hep Huzzah! Your extreme derring-do and flinty, unflinching gaze shall be praised in verse by our many fine amateur poets. Set out for ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system, post haste! For your valiant and heroic efforts, you shall be awarded ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks as material recompensation, though I daresay, living forever in our densely florid prosaic works can't be affixed with a price.
0x0000002C QUERY STATUS: Affirmative; Mission accepted.~p~TARGET SYSTEM: ~mission_target_star~.~p~TARGET PLANET: ~mission_target_planet~~p~MISSION OVERVIEW: Destroy or capture all metropolitan areas on target planet.~p~COMPENSATION: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000002D ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~, has a full range of offensive and defensive armament, but the Grand Council expresses its confidence in your ability to neutralize the aggressor forces.
0x0000002E Our attackers are known to inhabit ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~. Travel there at once and return the planet to a state of nature!
0x0000002F The willful and degenerate enemy, who worship the false God That Will Come, are at ~mission_target_planet~.   Destroy them, and Spode will reward you.
0x00000030 The enemy are at ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~. They are intractable, and implacably hostile. You can aid us by destroying or capturing their cities.
0x00000031 Our aesthetic technicians have had a look at the warmongers' planet, and the architecture is unspeakably dreary. If you could fly to ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and destroy or capture all the cities, something worthwhile might be built on the ruins.~p~Or not.
0x00000032 The vile enemy congregate at ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~. Level their cities! Let the survivors have nothing to eat but the ashes of the dead!
0x00000033 We feel that the world of ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~, is choked with urban blight. The inhabitants might be less belligerent if they lived free in nature, so please destroy or capture all cities.
0x00000034 The universe raises up life forms only to fling them into the flames. Only the ~mission_source_empire~ are eternal.~p~The enemy are at ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~. Fling them into the flames by destroying or capturing their cities.
0x0000017E ~mission_target_planet~ belongs to the ~mission_target_empire~, and orbits ~mission_target_star~. We require you to destroy all cities.
0x0000017F ~mission_target_planet~ belongs to the ~mission_target_empire~, and orbits ~mission_target_star~. We're counting on you to travel there and destroy all cities!
0x00000035 Alright. Sounds like a challenge I'll do it.
0x00000036 Wetworks! Sounds like a larf! I'll do it.
0x00000037 I've always wanted to really lay into those guys. I'll do it.
0x00000038 The ~mission_target_empire~? I hate those guys. I'm in!
0x0000009A Anything to serve you.
0x00000039 This feels like bad karma, times a bajillion.
0x0000003A I just can't tolerate this level of violence.
0x0000003B No way. No how. Not now. Not ever.
0x0000003C No. No. A million times no.
0x000000B5 With much regret, I cannot do what you ask.
0x0000003D You have performed this grave task unflinchingly. For that, we salute you. Thank you for your tireless service. Here is ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, for any hardships you may have endured in the course of this assignment.
0x0000003E Heeey, buddy! Is the ~mission_target_empire~ gone from ~mission_target_planet~? Yes? That's just super-awesome! What they said was just rude, regardless of the mom in question, right? My mom, your mom. What's important is justice was served. Here is what we promised: ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x0000003F Oh, my. We just don't know what to say. You've spared us from terrible humiliation, and removed a grave threat from the galaxy as well, no doubt. We don't know how we can repay you.~p~Oh, wait. Yes, we do - the specified amount: ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x00000040 Ha! We're almost proud of ya. The ~mission_target_empire~ got what was comin' to them... ~mission_target_planet~ is now ours for the taking, thanks to you! Now, there's the little matter of your reward: ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Don't say we never gave you nothin'.
0x00000041 Ho! Who goes there?~p~Ahh, our great hero returns, borne on the blessed wings of victory, no less!~p~Shhhh! Listen! Can you hear it? It's the sound of a million quills taking to parchment, singing your praises in prose! The ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks reward must seem so paltry in comparison.
0x00000042 MISSION STATUS: Success.~p~SUMMARY: ~mission_target_empire~ has been downsized from ~mission_target_planet~.~p~PAYMENT: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~NOTES: Clerical error detected. Wrong empire targeted. Don't tell the supervisor.
0x00000043 The war for civilization has been brought to a triumphant conclusion. The Grand Council is pleased to award you the Certificate of Commendation, First Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000044 Thank you for helping us defeat our enemies. Please take ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Now the task of rebuilding their ecosphere can begin.
0x00000045 The enemies of Spode are dust on the solar wind! May you enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks and the blessings of Spode. Please take a free copy of our scriptures with you as you leave.
0x00000046 The aggressors have been crushed, and much useful data has been harvested about their capabilities... and yours. Enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and our thanks.
0x00000047 There is a certain pleasure in contemplating the stern majesty of ruins, especially when they belong to another species. Have ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and maybe we can blow up a planet together some time!
0x00000048 We go to dance in the ashes of destroyed enemy cities - but not before giving you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks and allowing you to visit our emporium.
0x00000049 You've done quite well, though of course we realize that you are a victim as well. We hope any post-traumatic stress may be alleviated by the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000004A The enemy have been consigned to the flames. We honor you for your actions in a war that was not entirely your own, and we offer you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x00000180 Your military capabilities are noted. Take ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000181 Congratulations on your stirring victory, Captain! We'll build you a statue as soon as the budget permits, but in the meantime have these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000004B Thanks. Now let's discuss something more...
0x0000004C Next on the agenda...
0x0000004D Let's talk about something else.
0x0000004E Let's take this further...
0x0000004F I've been cleansing, yet I feel dirty. Such rich irony. I'll take a break.
0x00000050 I had fun. Call me anytime.
0x00000051 Nothing satisfies at the end of the day like global destruction.
0x00000052 That's tiring work. I could use a rest. Bye!
0x000000B6 Thank you. Now, please excuse me. I must be going..
0x00000053 You forgot your mission, didn't you? Have you been taking neuropsin suppressors? They are ideal for war-faring species, but they do tend to cloud the mind.~p~The planet of ~mission_target_planet~ is still occupied by the ~mission_target_empire~. Rid ~mission_target_planet~ of these hostile forces. For the Empire!
0x00000054 You forgot the mission? I know how it goes. It's tough when a whole species talks bad about your mom. It just gets you so angry, you forget the little stuff. It's okay.~p~You need to go to ~mission_target_planet~ and get rid of the ~mission_target_empire~. For the things they said. About your mom.
0x00000055 You forgot your mission? It must have been something we did. Please, forgive us! We'll recap:~p~We have suffered cruel bullying at the hands of the ~mission_target_empire~. You have agreed to go to ~mission_target_planet~ and put these bullies on permanent time-out. Destroy or capture every city you find!
0x00000056 What! It's you? Listen here, bub! The people we hire, they don't stay hired if'n they keep forgetting what it is they're supposed to be doing! Sheesh! It's been so long, I'm a little hazy on the specifics, myself. I know I wanted you to go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and rid it of the ~mission_target_empire~. I can't 'member why - just do it!
0x00000057 The ~mission_target_planet~ is still invaded by the ~mission_target_empire~. Get them out of that planet.
0x00000058 MISSION STATUS: Incomplete.~p~MISSION TARGET: ~mission_target_planet~~p~MISSION GOAL: Eliminate the ~mission_target_empire~ from the planet.
0x00000059 The militarists of ~mission_target_planet~ remain a menace to civilization! Will you help us defeat them? All relevant data should be listed in your Mission Log.
0x0000005A The cities of ~mission_target_planet~ are still standing. Our enemies' aggression goes unpunished. Your own Mission Log is witness to the fact that you agreed to help us. Will you complete your mission?
0x0000005B Did you not swear to crush the enemies of Spode at ~mission_target_planet~. Yet their cities still stand! Your Mission Log bears witness to your promise! Will you act in accordance with your oath before Spode?
0x0000005C Our scans indicate that the enemy still resists at ~mission_target_planet~. Has your Mission Log not received the commission? Will you destroy or capture their cities?
0x0000005D We hate to remind you, but you said you'd go to ~mission_target_planet~ and estroy-day the ities-say. Consult your Mission Log if you think we're lying! When can we expect some aesthetically-satisfying eruptions of debris?
0x0000005E We express astonishment that beings of your puissance have failed to destroy or capture the cities of ~mission_target_planet~. Our contract is recorded in your Mission Log! Will you crush our enemies as you promised?
0x0000005F You haven't finished letting the flowers bloom on ~mission_target_planet~! Will you finish your mission? Check your Mission Log if you're uncertain about the details.
0x00000060 Cities still stand on ~mission_target_planet~. Your orders are in your Mission Log. Why have you not carried them out?
0x00000182 We are informed that you have failed to destroy cities on ~mission_target_planet~, despite our downloading all necessary information into your Mission Log. Do you intend to obey orders?
0x00000183 You haven't destroyed the cities on ~mission_target_planet~! We need this to happen as soon as possible! All necessary information should be in your Mission Log!
0x00000061 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000062 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000063 Let's talk about something else.
0x00000064 Let's take this further...
0x00000065 My conscience can't bear this. I give up.
0x00000066 This is too horrific. I quit.
0x00000067 I just can't do it. Find someone else.
0x00000068 I give up. Sorry.
0x00000069 That's right. Bring them to heel.
0x0000006A I remember now. Make with the boom boom.
0x0000006B Ahh, yes. Global Annihilation. Got it.
0x0000006C Aha! Destroy or capture them! That's the part I forgot.
0x0000006D You failed to destroy or capture them on time. Pity.
0x0000006E The Grand Council is alarmed at the strength of the enemy. In compensation for the damaged you have sustained, I am authorized to offer you a Certificate of Commendation, Second Class.
0x0000006F Thank you for doing what you could. This wretched, destructive war will go on
0x00000070 Alas that you were defeated by the heathen! Spode shall wreak vengeance in his own time.
0x00000071 Analysis of the battle demonstrates the strength of the enemy defenses. Examination of the data surrounding your wretched failure may point the way to future success.
0x00000072 But we had such confidence in your invincibility! Maybe another time...
0x00000073 We are both of us weak and wretched species! We shall go into mourning for both our races.~p~But first, perhaps, you will wish to visit our boutique.
0x00000074 We're sorry to see that you failed. Unfortunately this terrible war will go on.
0x00000075 Our tacticians have learned from your failure. That's the best thing that can be said.
0x00000184 Your tactics were inadequate. We shall complete destruction of the ~mission_target_empire~ ourselves.
0x00000185 What a horrific defeat! How can we beat the ~mission_target_empire~ now? 
0x00000076 Let's talk about something else.
0x000000B7 I just need more time to do the job right.
0x00000077 Sorry.
0x000000B8 This wasn't worth the risk, anyway.
0x00000078 Thank you! It pains us to send you on a task such as this, but we've exhausted our every option. Be strong.
0x00000079 Ho yeah, buddy! It's on! It's on like Tronkey-Kong! Kick 'em in their Oort Clusters! They can't talk about your moms that way!~p~Let us know how it goes.
0x0000007A You agree? We're... we're besides ourselves with gratitude. We don't know how to thank you. We are so unworthy! We prostrate ourselves before you. I'm totally misting up here.
0x0000007B Yeah, you think you got the goods, do ya? Well, let's see what ya got. The job's yours to lose. Have at 'em!
0x0000007C We shall light a candle for each night you are gone. We ooze with anticipation of your safe passage, righteous victory, and speedy return. Literally ooze. It's a problem we have when we're anxious. Do be quick.
0x0000007D MISSION STATUS: Contractor accepts; must provide own medical, dental.
0x0000007E You have demonstrated the instincts of a good galactic citizen.~p~While we deplore the necessity of using violence against an intelligent species, in this case the inhabitants of ~mission_target_planet~ have shown themselves immune to reason, and we lack an alternative. Please travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture all cities.
0x0000007F Thank you for agreeing to help us. Travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture their cities.
0x00000080 Fly at once to ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture all cities! Let their young lament amid the ashes of their once-mighty towers!
0x00000081 The Way of Spode shows no mercy to those who resist his Word! Go to ~mission_target_planet~ and lay the cities waste. Do not leave one stone upon another!
0x00000082 Speed as fast as you can to ~mission_target_planet~. Let Spode's Holy Fire cleanse all their cities. Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! You can also capture them.
0x00000083 Travel immediately to ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture their cities. Only a complete job can save the both of us from retaliation.
0x00000084 We applaud your vigor and decisive attitude! Fly at once to ~mission_target_planet~ and let nature bloom amid the ruins of their cities!
0x00000085 This wretched being capers in delight!~p~Please travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture all cities! Let nothing remain!
0x00000086 We're pleased that you find yourselves in philosophical agreement with us. We'll chant for your success.
0x00000087 Go at once. You have your orders.
0x00000186 Move swiftly and without mercy.
0x00000187 We're depending on you to bring the war to a victorious conclusion!
0x0000009B I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000009C Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000009D Also...
0x000000DD One more thing...
0x00000088 This is gonna be good.
0x00000089 Call me Janitor, 'cause I'm about to do some cleaning!
0x0000008A You can count on me. They won't know what hit 'em!
0x0000008B I will leave smoking holes where once were proud cities!
0x0000008C I can't say your actions will aid your reputation, but I can't say I blame you either. Intergalactic extermination is a tricky business, fraught with all sorts of knotty ethical dilemmas.
0x0000008D I can't believe you're going to just let this slide! I mean - this is how it begins, right? First, they talk bad about your mom, but it's cool. Rise above.~p~But then they start saying other things, and soon, there's no limit to amount of smack they can talk. Then what? I only say this to you as a friend.
0x0000008E No? Oh, well we apologize profusely if we disturbed you in anyway. We had to ask.~p~I suppose we'll get used to it. It's not like we haven't been stuffed into lockers before. Or worse.
0x0000008F Bah! What good're ya, anyways? There's one thing and one thing only that we can count on you for: disappointment!~p~You're the reason we over eat! Get outta our sight!
0x00000090 Though 'tis us that shall bear the mighty onslaught of the ravening hordes of the ~mission_target_empire~. Already, the airwaves are filled with songs of your perennial failures. I'd hide your face for awhile.
0x00000091 MISSION STATUS: Rejected by Contractor.~p~FEELINGS: Snubbed.~p~SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS: Contractor will not receive a holiday card this year.~p~TRANSMISSION ENDED.
0x00000092 We understand the reluctance to employ violence. Let us suggest next time, don't get wrapped up in the details. Farewell.
0x00000093 We understand your reluctance. We'll have to face this menace on our own.
0x00000094 You will not aid Spode in accordance with his Will? The faithful shall take note of your refusal. Goodbye.
0x00000095 We understand your reluctance. You should hope that you won't be next on the enemy's target list.
0x00000096 Already a dozen massive parties cancelled! Sheesh!
0x00000097 We are devastated! We are a weak, sniveling species, and now we must fight alone. You credit line at the bazaar is suspended. Goodbye.
0x00000098 In that case, we'll have to attack the enemy on the astral plane. Stay out of the way.
0x00000099 Nature does not understand the concept of neutrality.
0x00000188 Defiance of the Grox has a low percentage chance of positive outcome.
0x00000189 But, but... we're at war! Quitting is desertion.
0x000000DE I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000DF Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000E0 Also...
0x000000E1 One more thing...
0x0000009E The universe is a cold, empty place sometimes.
0x0000009F Jeez, you don't have to be testy about it!
0x000000A0 You know, words can hurt, too! Words can hurt, too.
0x000000A1 Are you trying to make me feel guilty? It's not working.
0x000000B9 I beg your understanding.
0x000000A2 I can't say your actions will aid your reputation, but I can't say I blame you, either. Intergalactic extermination is a tricky business, fraught with all sorts of knotty ethical dilemmas.
0x000000A3 Oooh! I can not believe what I am hearing! You don't start an interplanetary cleansing program and just quit mid-way. It makes everyone look bad. People misunderstand, they hold grudges. You know?
0x000000A4 You're... quitting?~p~*Gulp*~p~Oh, this makes things much worse! Much, much worse.~p~Not that it's your fault! We meant no offense!
0x000000A5 Bah! What good're ya, anyways? There's one thing and one thing only that we can count on you for: disappointment!~p~Nothing worse than a weak-willed mercenary. Get outta our sight!
0x000000A6 Though 'tis us that shall bear the mighty onslaught of the ravening hordes of the ~mission_target_empire~, you shall wither under the poison pen of our of slighted poets - we shall curse you with a trillion sonnets. You forget - we have your email address!
0x000000A7 MISSION STATUS: Terminated by Contractor.~p~FEELINGS: Betrayal, disappointment...~p~IRRELEVANT!~p~IRRELEVANT!~p~TRANSMISSION ENDED.
0x000000A8 I will report to the Grand Council that your behavior has taken a sinister turn. Goodbye.
0x000000A9 Are you in league with our enemies?
0x000000AA Beware Spode's vengeance for this oath-breaking and treachery.
0x000000AB Available data suggests that you are not long for this galaxy.
0x000000AC This really wasn't the best time for one of your little jokes.
0x000000AD No rewards! No bazaar! You are a willful and treacherous species!
0x000000AE And people say that we're inconsistent!
0x000000AF Timing is everything with a stab in the back, and you have missed your stroke.
0x0000018A Defiance of the Grox can mean extinction.
0x0000018B You can't give up! This is a matter of survival!
0x000000E2 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000E3 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x000000E4 I'm sorry. But I would like to ask something else...
0x000000E5 One more thing...
0x000000B0 Why can't we all just get along?
0x000000B1 You're going to have to find another way. War sucks!
0x000000B2 Tough oogies. I'm done with this.
0x000000B3 In time, your anger will subside.
0x000000CB I beg your understanding.
0x000000B4 ...
0x000000CC Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!
0x000000CD I need to review my mission.
0x000000CE The details of my mission have escaped me.
0x000000CF I'd like to review the details of my mission.
0x000000D0 Restate your request. My notes are unclear.
0x000000D1 Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!
0x000000D2 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000D3 Also...
0x000000D4 One more thing...
0x000000D5 I'd rather do something else.
0x000000D6 I need to decline this task.
0x000000D7 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x000000D8 I beg to be released from this task.
0x000000D9 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000DA Until we speak again. So long.
0x000000DB I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000DC I beg your understanding.
