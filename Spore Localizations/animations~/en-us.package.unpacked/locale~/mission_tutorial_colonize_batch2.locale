0x00000003 We need you to help grow our empire a bit more. Sure, we've come pretty far from having just our home planet, but we haven't gone far enough!~p~It's clear that there are a lot of other species out there, and they are all trying to carve out little pieces of the galaxy. We need to carve out a bigger piece for ourselves, before we get crowded out!
0x00000007 Tell me more. I'm fascinated!
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x00000002 It's up to you how you want to colonize these additional star systems. Plopping colonies on unoccupied planets is always a sure fire solution.~p~If you're finding good locations hard to come by, you may want to consider taking systems from other species either by brute force, or establishing trade routes with allies and purchasing them outright.
0x00000022 Let's do this.
0x00000029 Reject
0x00000033 Well done! With ~mission_badge_needed_total~ stars to our name, we ~player_creature_name~ have built an interstellar empire worthy of respect.~p~But we can't stop just here... There's so much left to explore! Think of all the empires we haven't met! And we still don't know what's happening at the center of the galaxy...~p~We reached our goal of controlling ~mission_badge_needed_total~ stars. It's your choice where to go from here.
0x00000034 Yippee! Before I go...
0x0000003A I'm off to try my Soothing Song!
0x00000004 What are you doing back here? Our empire can't grow if you're not helping it!~p~I don't know what you've been up to, but planting new colonies should be your top priority. Use your colony tool on new planets until our empire spans ~mission_badge_needed_total~ different star systems.
0x0000004A Got it. One other thing...
0x0000004E Keep the training fee... but I'm dropping out.
0x00000053 Now you see me, now you don't.
0x0000000E Great! Our immediate goal is to have colonies on ~mission_badge_needed_total~ different star systems.~p~There's one more thing which might be important. Our strategists have been analyzing the layouts of other empires. They haven't reached any conclusions, but the data is definitely pointing towards something. It's pointing towards the center of the galaxy.~p~Get out there and grow our empire to ~mission_badge_needed_total~ star systems! And try to pick stars that are closer to the center of the galaxy. If something is out there, we'll want to know about it sooner or later.
0x00000005 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000005F Now you see me, now you don't.
0x0000000F You're not interested?~p~I guess being a teeny, weeny little empire isn't the worst thing. If you're trying to win the Eeny Teeny Weeny Little Empire award.
0x0000006B I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000071 Now you see me, now you don't.
0x00000010 You can't quit now, your mission is not complete.~p~I'll cancel the parade.
0x00000006 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000007E Now you see me, now you don't.
0x00000084 ...
0x00000008 I'm supposed to do what, now?
0x00000009 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000085 Now you see me, now you don't.
0x00000011 Colonize ~mission_badge_needed_left~ more star ~^p^mission_badge_needed_left^system^systems~.
0x00000012 Return home to complete mission.
0x00000013 Use your Colony Incredi-Pak to colonize a planet.
0x00000014 Mission Control is looking forward to the good news.
0x00000016 Place colonies on ~mission_badge_needed_total~ unique star systems to expand your Empire. Placing colonies is not the only way to secure additional colonized planets. You can conquer other Empire planets or you can establish trade routes, which will lead to the ability to purchase them.~p~Once you've completed your mission, return to your homeworld.~p~Completing this mission will earn you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000017 Congratulations! Return home to complete your mission.
