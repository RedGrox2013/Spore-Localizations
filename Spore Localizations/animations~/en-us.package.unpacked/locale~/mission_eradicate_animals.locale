0x00000000 We do have something, actually. It pays ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, but unfortunately it involves animal euthanasia.~p~Certain conservatory societies have taken an interest in planet ~mission_target_planet~. They have decided that all further genetic variance should be monitored and suppressed.~p~They have identified a species on the cusp of an evolutionary deviation, and need you to cull certain individuals from the herd to prevent this.
0x00000002 Oh, we're so lucky you came along! We have an urgent task, but we don't have the heart to carry it out ourselves. It's too awful!~p~It's the adorable ~mission_target_animal_species~ species! ~mission_num_kills_needed~ of them have come down with the dreaded Oogie Fever! If it spreads, it'll wipe them all out!~p~The infected animals must be... *gulp*... eradicated.~p~We'll pay you! ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Sound good?
0x00000003 You want something to do? Why, sure. We got something that'll get rid of you. I mean, we have a task.~p~Why don't you... oh, I don't know... let's say... kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ specific ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~.~p~Yeah, that sounds like it could take you a while. Do that.~p~We'll pay you. How's... ~mission_rewards~ Spucks sound? Will that be enough to get you to leave?
0x00000004 Fortune smiles upon you today, my fair entity. We have just such a task!~p~We have entered planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the Spaceminster Planetary Show-off Exhibition. It's the most prestigious event of its kind, and we've worked so hard preparing planet ~mission_target_planet~. Everything is just perfect!~p~Almost perfect, to be more precise. A small passel of ~mission_target_animal_species~ refuse to behave properly. The show is nearly upon us. Sadly, they must be eradicated.
0x00000006 In order that the inhabitants of planet ~mission_target_planet~ be secure, they must be made safe from predatory life-forms. Would you be willing to undertake a mission to eradicate the carnivorous ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~?
0x00000007  The Grand Council guarantees that our citizens shall live free from fear. A sub-contractor surveying planet ~mission_target_planet~ prior to settlement failed to notice that the herbivores known as ~mission_target_animal_species~ were about to enter a carnivorous cycle. The Grand Council would be pleased if you were to aid in eradicating planet ~mission_target_planet~ of this menace.
0x00000009 Our sanctuary on planet ~mission_target_planet~, heretofore a model of zeal and piety, is now threatened by fiery, demonic beings. Will you deliver the faithful from this menace?
0x0000000A Followers of the false God that Will Come have spread a plague among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you help us eradicate this menace?
0x0000000B According to the laws of Spode, animals should be a help to the faithful. Yet a species of animal has risen up to plague the righteous! Will you aid us in destroying this unnatural menace?
0x0000000C ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. A misplaced digit in a planetary survey has resulted in one of our planets in the ~mission_source_empire~ being seeded with the wrong sub-species. This aggressive animal is not only attacking other animals, but has become a threat to our citizens.~p~Would you be interested in helping us eradicating ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~?
0x0000000D A plague has spread among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~. This threatens to unhinge the planet's entire ecology! Can you help us avert disaster by eradicating the infected animals!
0x0000000E Illegal gene-hackers have altered the DNA of one of the animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~, and it has now become a menace to other animals and even to our citizens! Can you help us?
0x0000000F ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We regret to report that one of our experiments has not fulfilled its expectations. Instead of a placid, domesticated animal, a malprogrammed gene-splicer has inadvertently produced a ferocious, carnivorous species on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you be interested in helping us to rectify this error?
0x00000010 There is nothing more pathetic than a fashion gone out of date. We are no longer amused by our mutant glow beasts on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you dispose of them for us?
0x00000011 The joke is certainly on us! For aesthetic reasons, we created genetically altered animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. They're very pretty, but now they're eating us! Can you keep us from becoming lunch?
0x00000012 We went on a joyride and glow-splotched some of the animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. How were we to know that glow-splotching infuriates this species? Can you aid us by turning the rampaging animals into aesthetically-satisfying cones of ash?
0x00000013 This miserable being is reluctant to bring himself to your attention, but an emergency compels him. A peaceful settlement of ~mission_source_empire~ has been attacked by predatory life-forms. This wretched one hopes you will be willing to undertake a mission to eradicate the carnivorous ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~. A successful mission will be blessed with rewards!
0x00000014 I am doleful at having to disturb your excellence with this news, but I am reluctantly compelled to inform you that planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been attacked by ravenous beasts, endangering the happiness of our people. In return for rewards, would you be willing to deal with this emergency?
0x00000015 Woe is us! Word has reached our ears that a plague has spread among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~, turning them aggressive and violent. Humbly we request that your splendor, in return for adequate rewards, destroy these beasts.
0x00000016 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. An unknown plague has begun to affect animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~, turning them into dangerous predators. May we employ you to eradicate them?
0x00000017 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. An experiment in herbivory has gone disastrously wrong on planet ~mission_target_planet~, resulting in a formerly harmless species going mad and attacking other animals and even pack members. Can you help us with our little problem?
0x00000018 While we try to be at one with Nature, sometimes Nature's method of being at one with us involves having us for dinner. Such is the case on ~mission_target_planet~, where a mutation has turned one of the animals belligerent. We shrink from bloodshed, so will you take the necessary action?
0x00000019 One of our Chanting Circles on planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems to have called up the wrong spirit! We were hoping for a chat with our late Auntie Flrthrb, but instead we got a host of bodiless entities that possessed a group of animals, all of which are now running amok! Can you discorporate these beings for us? 
0x0000001A We try to be friends with all our animal brethren, but on ~mission_target_planet~ some of the animals have picked up a hostile vibration and are now wreaking havoc. Can you de-tune these creatures? Preferably with a laser? 
0x0000001B As trees strive to reach the sun, so animals too are part of a constant struggle for resources and mastery. One animal on planet ~mission_target_planet~ now threatens to dominate the world as we dominate the galaxy. Such an unstable situation should not be permitted to continue. Do you agree?
0x0000001C The playful winds may carry the scent of flowers, or the stench of plague. An epidemic, perhaps spread by a cowardly enemy, has infected animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The infected are enraged and turned into predators. Would target practice interest you?
0x0000001D We live in a cosmos filled with incredible violence, from the Big Bang and gamma ray emitters to the single-celled animals that engulf their prey. One animal on planet ~mission_target_planet~ displays courage and aggression bordering on madness. Perhaps they are a threat to security.
0x00000008 An infection needs eradication. Is your stomach strong enough to handle the job?
0x000000D7 We require you to visit planet ~mission_target_planet~ and kill troublesome animals.
0x000000D8 A cull of useless animals is taking place on planet ~mission_target_planet~. You will participate.
0x000000D9 You will give us a demonstration of your military capabilities on planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x000000DA Plague-ridden animals are attacking our settlement on  planet ~mission_target_planet~! We need your help!
0x000000DB A carnivorous animal species is attacking on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you aid us?
0x000000DC A harmless virus on planet ~mission_target_planet~ has mutated into a threat to wildlife. Will you give us help?
0x0000001E Tell me more...
0x0000001F Can I get some directions?
0x00000020 How do I get there?
0x00000021 How can I find it?
0x00000022 Oooh. Bad karma. No, thanks.
0x00000023 I'm a pacifist. I'm not going to do this.
0x00000024 I'm not the right match for this mission.
0x00000025 I... uhhh... have a conflict. I can't.
0x00000027 Cool cool. We need ya to kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ tagged ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~. You'll be able to identify them by their glow once you're planet-side.~p~Some facts: ~group:star_clue~. The planet you're looking for is called planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~We'll hook you up with ~mission_rewards~ Spucks if you do this for us.~p~Hurry hurry!
0x00000029 Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~group:star_clue~.~p~Kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ tagged ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~. We assume this is not a problem.
0x0000002A Blark! ~mission_num_kills_needed~ ~mission_target_animal_species~ have been identified for removal, and tagged with a substance to allow you to easily identify them - they'll glow...~p~Hoo heee! Wouldn't that be fun to glow! We do have to keep that in mind for the next Flortondian Reblix Day! Do you like Flortondian plorplie? I find it needs more salt... generally speaking.~p~Wait... Are you still here...? Don't you know where to go...?~p~~group:star_clue~. The planet name is ~mission_target_planet~.~p~You shall be paid ~mission_rewards~ Spucks as recompense.
0x0000002C These creatures, this hellspawn called ~mission_target_animal_species~ must be cleansed by laser fire. Let their flames be quenched by your righteousness.~p~Creatures numbering ~mission_num_kills_needed~ must be cleansed if the planet is to be made pure again. Know ye this: ~group:star_clue~.
0x0000002D Travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~group:star_clue~.~p~The unfortunate animals, ~mission_target_animal_species~, have glowing tails. This feature should make them easy to track down and kill.~p~Kill at least ~mission_num_kills_needed~ of ~mission_target_animal_species~ in order to avert disaster. The planet's Life Web is balanced in all other particulars, so do not kill any uninfected animals, or harm any other things.~p~Hurry, before the problem gets completely out of control.
0x0000002E Your contract calls for the 'restructuring and removal' of creatures numbering ~mission_num_kills_needed~ in the name of ~mission_target_animal_species~ to a vapor state.~p~Planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~group:star_clue~.~p~The targeted animals may be identified by their glowing tails. Eradication can be made from the air in perfect safety. Please hurry and accomplish the mission before trouble spreads.~p~Remember, the clause 45.6.2 specifies that no other animals or objects on planet ~mission_target_planet~ be injured during the execution of this contract..
0x0000002F ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Eliminate ~mission_num_kills_needed~ of the targeted animals. ~p~You must complete this mission quickly, before the rampaging animals get completely out of hand. Head to planet ~mission_target_planet~ immediately! ~group:star_clue~.
0x00000032 This story unfolds on planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~group:star_clue~. Alas, it is known, in order to maintain harmony, ~mission_num_kills_needed~ need be removed from the lovely wild ~mission_target_animal_species~ herds.
0x00000033 Eradicating this species is a task unworthy of us, but it may be suitable for a species such as you. Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in danger of being overrun by ~mission_target_animal_species~. Their tails glow, so killing them should be ridiculously easy.~p~Kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ of the dangerous animals. ~group:star_clue~.~p~We will be watching, to make certain you complete this mission quickly and on schedule.
0x000000DD Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~group:star_clue~.~p~Kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ tagged ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~. That is all you need know.
0x000000DE On planet ~mission_target_planet~ you will find ~mission_target_animal_species~. These animals have glowing trails, so it shouldn't be hard to find them. Kill them all, but don't harm buildings, animals, or natives.~p~~group:star_clue~. The planet ~mission_target_planet~ will be in the vicinity.
0x00000034 Yeah, I think I can do this.
0x00000035 I could get into this. Yeah.
0x00000036 Killing defenseless animals. Count me in!
0x00000037 Yeah, sure. I'll do it.
0x00000038 This mission is terrible. I'm out.
0x00000039 I won't do it. It's wrong.
0x0000003A No way. I'm not killing animals!
0x0000003B No. No. Never. No. Sorry.
0x0000003C Excellent work, as always. You are held in high regard throughout the colonies.~p~I believe you were promised ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks as payment, yes?~p~It's always a pleasure doing business with a name you can trust.
0x0000003D Hey, wow. I can't thank you enough. That was so rad of you to get us out of that jam... Here's your ~mission_rewards~ Spucks, as promised.~p~We'd have done it ourselves, but we're thinking about a career in politics, so we can't be seen doing things like that.~p~Even if it is all in the service of THE MIGHTY GROX!!! HAIL THEM!!!
0x0000003E Oh, hurray! Oh joy! Thank you for helping out those sweet things in their hour of need.~p~Before you came, we tried sending in elite squads of highly-trained soldiers to eliminate the sick ourselves, but when they looked into those great big eyes...~p~We just couldn't do it! The Cuteness! The Cuteness!
0x0000003F Oh.~p~It's you again. That was quick.~p~Well, ain't you an industrious little busybody. Ain't you a little flitty-flighty so-and-so.~p~If we pay you now, will you leave again?~p~Here. Here's ~mission_rewards~ Spucks, like we said. Now why don't you make like an Aldrin and buzz off.
0x00000040 Wondrous, joyous, rapturous applause awaits us at the Spaceminster Planetary Show-off Exhibition this year! You have virtually assured us of receiving Best in Show, you kind, kind soul.~p~Here is your bounty, as promised. ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and worth every bit of it, a thousand-fold.
0x00000042 Welcome ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~The Grand Council is pleased with your conduct. You are to be awarded a Certificate of Commendation, Second Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000043 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Thou has proven worthy of our trust. Please take these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and may Spode enlighten you.
0x00000044 We thank you and the ecosystem on planet ~mission_target_planet~ thanks you even more. We're pleased to offer you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000045 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You have cleansed the planet ~mission_target_planet~. :Please take these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and endeavor to forget this incident as soon as possible.
0x00000046 Splendid! The surface of ~mission_target_planet~ is much more interesting with all those little craters! Take these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks!
0x00000047 Hello, hello ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You have righted what was not right. Well done, well done. Please gaze upon your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000048 Kind ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We welcome your return.~p~Thank you for having restored the balance with all our cute little animal friends. Have these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, over which we've chanted for hours!
0x00000049 ~player_creature_name~. It appears that you are capable of following simple instructions. These ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks are intended to provide positive reinforcement.
0x000000DF ~player_creature_name~. You have fulfilled our commands. As ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks are often required to motivate the cooperation of an organic species, we offer these to you.
0x000000E0 Great work, Captain! And look we have ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks just lying around! 
0x0000004A Let me ask you one other thing...
0x0000004B I have one other question...
0x0000004C May I ask you something?
0x0000004D Just one last thing...
0x0000004E That was unsettling. Good day.
0x0000004F What a rush! Thanks! See ya!
0x00000050 Hey, just doing my job.
0x00000051 Well. I guess I'll be on my way...
0x00000052 Hmmm. You forgot your mission? That's surprising. Your profile has a very high rating.~p~Well, never mind. Let's get you sorted:~p~Cull ~mission_num_kills_needed~ mutant ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~ on planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~You'll be able to spot the affected creatures by their glowing pheromone clouds. Happy hunting.
0x00000053 Hey, hey, friend. Listen, you know we like you as a sentient being, right? It's just professionally...~p~Well, look - just kill the ~mission_num_kills_needed~ ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~ on planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and it'll all be fine.~p~It's not about how *we* feel about you - it's just THE WISE AND EXACTING GROX DEMAND SERVITUDE TO THEIR OMNIPOTENCE!!!
0x00000054 Oh. Oh. We really don't want to be a bother. Really.~p~It's just that ~mission_num_kills_needed~ ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~ are sick with Oogie Fever! They're so virulent they glow! There's no time to be absent-minded!~p~Please, go to the ~mission_target_star~ system, and find planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~Kill all the infected animals. Don't let their adorable ways deter you like it did us!
0x00000055 I couldn't believe what I was seeing, until I heard you speak! Now I don't trust any of my 9 senses. I can't believe you came back before you finished! Bagh!~p~Listen closely: kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~, on planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~But the most important thing for you to remember is... to leave!
0x00000056 Please, be quick! The Spaceminster Planetary Show-off Exhibition grows ever nearer!~p~We shall summon all our skills of precision and concision, in re-capping to you your own endeavor:~p~Kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ tagged ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~, on planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~Otherwise, we'll be penalized and lose our chance at Best in Show.
0x00000058 The Grand Council views with concern the fact that you have not completed the eradication of ~mission_target_animal_species~. All parameters of the mission should be available in your Mission Log. Our citizens remain in peril. Will you travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy ~mission_target_animal_species~?
0x00000059 The Way of Spode is the Way of Truth. Did you speak truth when you said that you would travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy ~mission_target_animal_species~? Before you answer, bear in mind that Spode knows what's in your Mission Log.
0x0000005A Our reports indicate that ~mission_target_animal_species~ is still endangering planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you help us eradicate this menace? All relevant information should be in your Mission Log.
0x0000005B Curiously, you seem not to have gone to planet ~mission_target_planet~ in order to destroy ~mission_target_animal_species~. Were our instructions incomplete, was your Mission Log destroyed, or have you not managed to properly organize the data?
0x0000005C This unworthy one regrets extremely the necessity of pointing out that you have not destroyed ~mission_target_animal_species~, as specified in the contract recorded in your Mission Log. Will you travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy ~mission_target_animal_species~? Are you still interested in our rewards?
0x0000005D Let's play a little game called...I Know What's In Your Mission Log... I know that your Mission Log holds text of your agreement go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy ~mission_target_animal_species~!
0x0000005E We were chanting to send friendly vibrations your way at planet ~mission_target_planet~, but now we find you're here instead! We thought you were going to remove ~mission_target_animal_species~ from this plane of existence?~p~Isn't all the information in your Mission Log?
0x0000005F It was our understanding that you were to go to  planet ~mission_target_planet~ in order to destroy ~mission_target_animal_species~. Data from your Mission Log confirms this.~p~You waft like flotsam on the tide. Our patience is not unlimited.
0x000000E1 You have not eliminated ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~, despite our having downloaded all necessary information into your Mission Log.
0x000000E2 The deadly ~mission_target_animal_species~ hasn't been eliminated from planet ~mission_target_planet~. Check your Mission Log for the details and go there at once!
0x00000060 Let me ask you one other thing...
0x00000061 I have one other question...
0x00000062 May I ask you something?
0x00000063 Just one last thing...
0x00000064 I've decided I'm not going to do this.
0x00000065 This is unethical. I won't do it!
0x00000066 I quit. Sorry.
0x00000067 I'm done with this! It was hard!
0x00000068 Right. Got it. Bye.
0x00000069 That's right. Kill the animals.
0x0000006A Ahh, I see. I've got it now.
0x0000006B Okay. I understand. I'll return shortly.

Don't shoot any other species, or our lovely little homes, or for that matter us!~p~And hurry, before the ~mission_target_animal_species~ can do more damage.

0x000000E4 Hurry, Captain! This must be done quickly! You have only ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to eradicate the ~mission_target_animal_species~.
0x00000026 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000028 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000030 Also...
0x00000031 One more thing...
0x00000081 I will return shortly.
0x00000082 Be right back.
0x00000083 I'm off to kill some animals!
0x00000084 You can count on me.
0x00000085 Hmmm, that's unusual. We'd heard you generally accepted all manner of galactic quests.~p~Well, this is unfortunate. The ~mission_target_animal_species~ could evolve recklessly if we don't nudge them in the appropriate direction.~p~Not all species are so lucky as to have a good mentor. I guess we'll just roll the dice with the ~mission_target_animal_species~.
0x00000086 Awww...~p~C'mon, buddy. Don't leave us hangin, brah...~p~I thought you were cool!~p~Whatever!!!~p~I'm telling! I'm telling THE AWESOME AND MAJESTIC GROX on you!!!
0x00000087 Oh, no! When we saw you coming, I guess we just pinned all our hopes on you to save the ~mission_target_animal_species~ from their horrible fate.~p~I guess nothing can stop the Oogie Fever from spreading now! It's curtains for the ~mission_target_animal_species~!
0x00000088 Awwww, gee, that's too bad. I guess that means you'll be going far, far, far, far, far away now, right? And quickly, too, yeah?~p~This time we've shared together - no one can take that from us.~p~Now go! Be sure to travel fast and travel far, now.~p~Bye.
0x00000089 Oh, the wretched heavens have unleashed a torrent of misfortune upon us! We're upon the very cusp of the show itself, and there are so many other things to do!~p~We need to tape down the mesas and apply vaseline to the mountain caps, even still!~p~You likely just cost us the highly coveted Best in Show! We shall not forget this soon, you scoundrel!
0x0000008B The Grand Council will not compel any species to act against its will. These negotiations are at an end. Goodbye.
0x0000008C The Grand Council views with grave concern this failure of the ~player_creature_name~ to act in accordance with an agreement into which they entered freely. Goodbye.
0x0000008D Truly it is said that the heart of an unbeliever is a heart of stone. Goodbye.
0x0000008E We can only hope that the ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~ will survive without your help. Goodbye.
0x0000008F We will accomplish that task ourselves, then. Goodbye.
0x00000090 But you look so terrifically stunning with a blaster in your arms! Oh, well.
0x00000091 Oh dear, oh dear. To think of the rewards that could have been yours!
0x00000092 We'll have to hold a healing ceremony in order to recover from this rejection.
0x00000093 Such a simple task is beyond you? We shall take note.
0x000000E5 Do you refuse to obey orders?
0x0000008A I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000002B Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000041 Also...
0x00000057 One more thing...
0x0000006C Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x0000006D Perhaps another time. So long.
0x0000006E I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x0000006F I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x00000070 I beg your understanding.
0x0000009C Quitting? This is shocking.~p~You realize, these conservationists will talk about you. On their blogs!
0x0000009D Aborting the mission? This is...~p~you can't... The planet needs to be just right for our masters...~p~THE  COLD AND UNWAVERING GROX ARE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THIS!!!
0x0000009E Forgive me for saying so, but how could you be so callous?~p~The ~mission_target_animal_species~ are about to be extinguished, and you were the only one who could have saved them! Now, they're done for!~p~Oh, if we only had the courage to cull the ill ourselves!
0x0000009F Mission Aborted? Oh, no. How terrible.~p~Although, really, I think we'd be willing to still consider this a success if you, you know, leave. Quickly.~p~You're not getting paid, of course. Like, duh. But otherwise, just seeing you go feels like success.
0x000000A0 Oh, this is unimaginable! This can not be happening!~p~The judges will arrive any moment, and the planet is not ready, thanks to you!~p~Planet ~mission_target_planet~ will win the 'So-so Effort' award at best!
0x000000A2 In view of this willful disregard of your agreement, the Grand Council will have to seriously reconsider its attitude toward your species.
0x000000A3 The tongue of the heathen is the tongue of the liar. Goodbye.
0x000000A4 Your irresponsible attitude is noted.
0x000000A5 How curious. Goodbye.
0x000000A6 Your species tries so hard to amuse. A pity that you always fail.
0x000000A7 We will have to set aside the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks for a more reliable species.
0x000000A8 You are possessed by an erratic and wandering spirit.
0x000000A9 Is this the ~player_creature_name~ concept of honor?
0x000000E7 Defiance of a Grox order is tantamount to suicide.
0x000000E8 You're quitting? But we counted on you!
0x00000071 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000A1 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000094 Also...
0x00000095 One more thing...
0x00000096 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x00000097 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x00000098 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x00000099 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x0000009A I beg your understanding.
0x000000AE I think you would have benefited from looking up the definition of 'conservation' before you embarked on this journey.~p~If you decimate the entire population of ~mission_target_animal_species~, it makes it much more difficult conserve anything. Now, they're on the brink of annihilation.~p~Some help you are!
0x000000AF Oh, did you kill too many untagged creatures?~p~Did we not mention that's a no-no? It was a gardened planet, after all.~p~Yeah, uhhh... THE FASTIDIOUS AND EXACTING GROX... they... they are not gonna like this. Nope. Not a bit.~p~Hooboy, this is such a huge mess!
0x000000B0 Oh, no! This is a catastrophe!~p~Those, poor defenseless ~mission_target_animal_species~! So cute! So loving! And now, doomed! Doomed to extinction! It's too much to bear!~p~You killed too many healthy animals, and de-stabilized the whole population! What did they ever do to you!?!
0x000000B2 Calamity! This is beyond disastrous! Words... words fail us. Your recklessness has sent us reeling into the domain of pure, unfettered emotion.~p~We've gravely misjudged you. This task required deftness and precision, and you seem to lack both, you oaf!~p~The ~mission_target_animal_species~ have been completely de-stabilized, and there's no time to re-volumize. We've lost!
0x000000E9 ~player_creature_name~ you have failed to do what the Grox required of you. This has been noted.
0x00000005  ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Your irresponsible violence toward all species has resulted in serious harm to the world's delicate Food Web! We are dissapointed.
0x000000B4 Ho ho! ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~ returns... but methinks not so ~player_title~-ee afterall.~p~Did you shoot at all that moved?? Yes, 'tis a fun game as well... but 'tis not what we asked of you.~p~No Sporedecakes for you!
0x000000B5 You have returned ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~The Philosophy of Order specifically states the avoidance of disorder. Tragically, your irresponsible violence has caused irreparable disorder in the galaxy!~p~The Grand Council will have to refile your contracts as a risk to our Philosophy.
0x000000B6 Irreverent ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~Your reckless shooting has destroyed the harmony we worked so hard to create! Would that you grow and take more careful aim in the future.
0x000000B7 ~player_creature_name~. A true weapons master aims his weapon not at everything in sight, but only at the target.~p~Clearly you are not such a master.
0x000000EE Halt ~player_creature_name~!~p~Your indiscriminate shooting has done more damage than the hellspawn! We were led to believe you had a clear sense of good and evil. Clearly not!
0x000000B1 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000C9 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x000000E6 Also...
0x000000EA One more thing...
0x000000B9 But blowing stuff up is fun! So long.
0x000000BA But my way's more fun! Goodbye.
0x000000BB Oops. My bad. Farewell.
0x000000BC I see you need a moment. I'll return later.
0x000000EF Please accept my humble apology!
0x000000BD What what? We see you have returned in the opposite state of success! We were expecting the opposite of the opposite state of success!~p~Oh dear, oh dear! Plan B... we need a Plan B
0x000000BE Welcome ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We greet you once again on behalf of the Grand Council.~p~Speaking of which, I hate to tell them that you have failed your task. I will stamp it as 'in need of review'... by the time it works its way thru the filings and approvals... perhaps you will have had a chance to improve your reputation.
0x000000BF ~player_creature_name~ has been defeated by the hellspawn? Alas that they were so many! 
0x000000C0 Wow... so... welcome back.~p~We have heard you were unable to complete your task, which I must confess gives us some relief. Perhaps it was not to be.
0x000000C1 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Your species is incapable of following simple instructions. We will bear this in mind should we encounter you again.
0x000000C2 Ho ho! ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~ returns... but methinks not so ~player_title~-ee afterall.~p~Let's see... you were bested by a bunch of dumb beasts that glow in the dark and can't fight back.~p~Hee hee! Truly your ship has powerful zing! A shame it is such a secret! Ha!
0x000000C3 Kind ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, you have returned safely, but have failed in your efforts.~p~We do understand. It's hard to look in the eyes of one of our furry brethren and shoot them down in cold blood.
0x000000C4 ~race~ told ~player_creature_name~ to make haste on planet ~mission_target_planet~, but instead ~player_creature_name~ wasted time. ~player_creature_name~ efficiency is in question.
0x000000EB ~player_creature_name~ have failed to eliminate ~mission_target_animal_species~ within the time parameter specified. ~player_creature_name~ species is inefficient.
0x000000EC Welcome back Captain. We see you encountered some difficulties on your mission.~p~We're disappointed the didn't manage to eliminate ~mission_target_animal_species~ quickly enough. Perhaps more target practice is in order.
0x000000C5 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000C6 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x000000C7 Also...
0x000000C8 One more thing...
0x000000F0 I had some unforeseen issues. Goodbye.
0x00000107 I see you need a moment. I'll return later.
0x00000108 Please accept my humble apology!
0x000000CA ...
0x0000009B I need a little refresher on the mission...
0x000000AA Uhh... What am I supposed to do again?
0x000000AB I spaced on my mission. What is it again?
0x000000AC I forgot what I doing. What's my mission?
0x000000AD Can you remind me of my mission?
0x000000B3 Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x000000B8 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000CB Also...
0x000000CC One more thing...
0x000000CF I'd rather do something else.
0x000000D0 I need to decline this task.
0x000000D1 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x000000D2 I beg to be released from this task.
0x000000D3 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000D4 Until we speak again. So long.
0x000000D5 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000D6 I beg your understanding.
