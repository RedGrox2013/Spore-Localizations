0x00000000 Salutations ~ep1_captain_full_name~.  We've just received terrible news. We have reason to believe that C'Servoid scientists are constructing a giant weapon on the planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~We need someone to beam down there and take a closer look at their technology. You interested?
0x00000041 Too bad the TX-5000 exploded. With a bit of luck we can analyze the debris and find a way to reverse engineer the power source.~p~Of course, WE would never use the technology as a weapon. We are only interested in the...uh...potential to create clean, renewable energy.~p~Anyway, thanks for the help. You definitely earned these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000004E Everything you need to know is in your mission log.~p~Remember, you're there to gather scientific data. Try not to blow anything up.
0x00000064 Our spy, Bantuii, is already inside the base. Sneak past the guards and find him. He'll give you further instructions.~p~This is not a combat mission ~ep1_captain_full_name~! Stealth and patience are key.~p~Good luck!
0x00000071 Would you change your mind if we told you that our calculations show that you have a 92.3% chance to succeed?
0x00000081 We're not asking you to charge in with Pulsar weapons blazing. We only want a small sample of the TX-5000 technology.~p~If you stay out of sight the odds of you being vaporized are actually quite small.
