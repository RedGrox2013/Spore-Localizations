0x00000001 Captain, get out your spandex suit. We're sending you on a space journey.~p~We suspect we're not alone in this galaxy. We've picked up strange radio signals from planet ~mission_ufo_wreck_target_planet~ in orbit around our home star. We want you to investigate.
0x00000018 I accept.
0x00000024 Mission accomplished! We knew we weren't alone in the galaxy. Traces of an extinct civilization, hostile security drones, and The Grox.~p~It's obvious that we must continue our exploration of the galaxy and potentially prepare for hostilities.~p~In order to do so we'll need to set up colonies as bases of operation.~p~Our scientists are already reverse engineering the interstellar drive to replicate its technology. We've also developed a SETI device for your ship. It will pick up signals of other sentient life in the galaxy, indicated by radio signals over stars that you target.~p~We need you at the helm of our space program, Captain.

0x00000005 You still haven't visited planet ~mission_ruins_target_planet~?~p~You need to leave the solar system and travel to the ~mission_target_star~ system. There are questions that need to be answered.

0x00000008 You must go back and explore the ruins on planet ~mission_ruins_target_planet~.~p~This is a major scientific discovery that needs further research. We need to find clues as to why this sentient species went extinct.~p~Is our fate destined to be the same?
