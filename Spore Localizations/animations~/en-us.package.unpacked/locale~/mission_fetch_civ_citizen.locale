0x00000005 Praise the name of Spode! He has revealed to us the existence of another civilization! In order to determine whether this species is ready for the Word of Spode, we need to examine a native of ~mission_target_star~. Will you bring us one of these beings?
0x00000006 Spode's wonders are manifold. We have recently discovered the existence of a new race at ~mission_target_star~ system. Can you help us discover whether they are ready for the Word of Spode?

Would you be interested in aiding us?
0x00000008 On its foundation, the Grand Council wisely chose to create a detector array capable of sifting star systems for signs of intelligent life. Such signs have now been detected near ~mission_target_star~ system. Could you possibly investigate this on our behalf?
0x00000009 We recently intercepted a Grox transmission expressing interest in the civilization developing at ~mission_target_star~ system. We would like to find out as much about this new species as possible. Could we persuade you to investigate this matter for us?

0x0000000B One of our automated probes has returned from the ~mission_target_star~ system. Gamma ray bursts have destroyed much of the data, but it seems possible that another civilization may exist there. Would you be willing to help us discover the nature of any intelligent life?
0x0000000C Our radio receivers have detected a series of transmissions from ~mission_target_star~ system. These are indicative of intelligent life. Would you help us discover the nature of this new species?

0x0000000E We so enjoy misshapen alien races stumbling about in their hopeless way! Not that we're talking about you, we're referring to a new civilization at ~mission_target_star~ system. Could you possibly bring us one, so that we can amuse ourselves watching it? 
0x0000000F We enjoy novelty, and nothing says novelty like a brand-new civilization! There seems to be one over at ~mission_target_star~ system. Would you like to hop over there and fetch us a new friend?
0x00000010 We have recently learned of a new intelligent species rumored to be in the ~mission_target_star~ system.

A reward suitable to your splendor would be offered.
0x00000011 Radio emissions from the ~mission_target_star~ system suggest the presence of intelligent life! We are completely agog with the possibility that we can raise the happiness of an entire world through selling them things!~p~Will you aid our effort? Rewards will be offered.
0x00000012 A new intelligent species has been located at star system ~mission_target_star~! We will retool entire industries in order to advance their consumer satisfaction, but in the meantime we need to find out more about them. Will you help us, in exchange for generous compensation?

0x00000015 A species has been transmitting radio messages from star system ~mission_target_star~. Clearly they are unaware that this makes them a target. Can you help us investigate? 
0x00000016 Star system ~mission_target_star~ seems to have developed a civilization! We'd like to examine one of the natives in order to better help the world on its journey to spiritual oneness. Will you help?
0x00000017 We've been waiting a long time for the next Great Teacher. One of our seers suggests he may come from a new civilization recently detected at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Could you fetch one of the natives, so that we can ask him if he knows of any spiritual masters?
0x00000018 We discovered a new civilization at planet ~mission_target_planet~. We don't know if they're violent or not, so we thought you might try to make contact for us.
0x00000103 It is necessary to investigate a form of organic life in the ~mission_target_star~ system. You will aid us. 
0x00000104 You will help us to reconnoiter planet ~mission_target_planet~. Prepare for departure.
0x00000105 It is necessary to establish a threat matrix for the race on ~mission_target_star~ system. You will help us in this.

0x00000107 Transmissions from planet ~mission_target_planet~ indicate an advanced race! Captain, we'd like you to escort their new ambassador. 
0x00000108 We believe a civilization has risen on ~mission_target_star~ system. We'd like to investigate.
0x00000019 How can I find it?
0x0000001A I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x0000001B Ooh, sorry. I've got a thing.
0x0000001C I can't. I'm busy.
0x0000001D Star system ~mission_target_star~ is the home to a new civilization. We'd like you to bring one of their citizens to us, so that we can examine their potential for living in harmony with us.
0x0000001E A recon probe has revealed intelligent life at ~mission_target_star~ system. Bring us one of these beings, so that we may determine if they have been enlightened by Spode.
0x0000001F Travel to star system ~mission_target_star~. If you find intelligent life there, please spirit away one of its citizens, and bring that individual here so that we may discover more about them. 
0x00000020 An intelligent civilization may exist at ~mission_target_star~ system. We ask you to bring us one of these creatures, so that we may examine them and determine whether they are candidates for further development.
0x00000021 We enjoy novelty, and nothing says novelty like a brand-new civilization! There seems to be one over at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you like to hop over there and fetch us a new friend?
0x00000022 A civilization has sprung into being on ~mission_target_star~ system. We ask you to bring us one of their citizens, so that we may inundate their world with consumer items designed for them alone.
0x00000023 One of the worlds orbiting ~mission_target_star~ system holds an intelligent race. Bring us one of these creatures, so that the specimen can be evaluated.~p~Do not employ violence. Yet.
0x00000024 Travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ at ~mission_target_star~ system. Beam up one of the natives, and bring it here without harming it.
0x00000109 A species of organic life exists at ~mission_target_star~ system. They have built cities. Go there, acquire a member of this species, and bring it here.
0x0000010A Intelligent life has been found at ~mission_target_star~ system. We'd like you to travel there, beam up a member of this species, and return.
0x0000003F I accept your proposal.
0x00000040 This seems doable. I accept!
0x00000041 I can totally handle that.
0x00000042 I will do what you bid.
0x0000005F Oh no! I'm not putting THAT in my cargo hold!
0x0000006C Actually, I've just realized how busy I am.
0x00000025 Alas, I must reject this request.
0x00000026 I regret that I must decline.
0x00000027 You have returned to your people victorious! This ~mission_item~ cements the ~race~ as players on the intergalactic stage! For your efforts, please accept ~mission_rewards~.
0x00000028 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Look everyone - the handsome and fearless astro-hero has returned with the ~mission_item~! Doesn't he look great? Have you been working out? You look especially svelte. Anyway, we offer you a payment of ~mission_rewards~ for your exemplary work.
0x0000002E *Gasp*!!! The ~mission_item~ specimen - you have it! Inconceivable! Even though my people suffer from hypoglycemia and hemophilia, we have been selling our blood and other fluids in order to pay you the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks we owe.
0x0000002F ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. That coulda been quicker! You get lost in another universe or something? You got the ~mission_item~? Hey, it's slightly scuffed! Is that chipped paint? What's this stain? Well, I guess it's not *completely* ruined - here's ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000030 O, noble and intrepid explorer - you have brought us the ~mission_item~! The people of ~planet_name~ have retired to their parlor-rooms, busily composing sonnets and song of your most heroic travails! Our payment of ~mission_rewards~ Spucks alone is not adequate tribute. Perhaps you will come to our open mic night next month?
0x00000031  ~player_creature_name~. ChkChkChk. Specimen obtained. ~mission_item~ transfer to ~race~ complete. Payment tendered - ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. Business Concluded. End.
0x00000032 We thank you for this first contact with another intelligent species! We're happy to offer you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks, and our gratitude.
0x00000033 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. By all appearances, this creature is prepared to learn the Way of Spode! Go in peace, along with these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and the knowledge that you have helped to fulfill our great destiny.
0x00000029 The Grand Council thanks you for this opportunity to contact a new civilization. You are authorized the Certificate of Commendation, Second Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000002A The creature from ~mission_target_planet~ seems to be suitable for uplift. We can only be certain once we perform a vivisection, but in the meantime please accept these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks with our compliments.
0x0000002B This new species combines naive ingenue charm with an awkward physicality in a way that just guarantees hours of fun! Have ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and the knowledge that you have contributed to our amusement.
0x0000002C Soon we shall bury ~mission_target_star~ system in happiness! We thank you with these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and of course you are always welcome to visit the bazaar.
0x0000002D You have handled this matter well. We shall evaluate this creature and determine whether its species constitutes a threat to galactic order. Please accept these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000034 We're going to completely swarm this creature with spiritual excess! Thank you! Please enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and your karmic rewards as well.
0x0000010B  ~player_creature_name~. You have performed expeditiously. Take ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. We will examine the creature now.
0x0000010C Efficient work, Captain! We'll learn a lot from this new species. You are entitled to ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. 
0x00000035 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000036 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000037 Also...
0x00000038 One more thing...
0x00000039 A pleasure to help. So long.
0x0000003A No trouble at all. Farewell.
0x0000003B Anytime. See you later.
0x0000003C You are most generous. 
0x00000079 We were expecting you to bring us a citizen of ~mission_target_star~ system! Your own Mission Log verifies your agreement. Will you complete this assignment for us?
0x0000007A Did you not swear to bring us a citizen of ~mission_target_star~ system? Is this oath not witnessed by your Mission Log? Will you keep your solemn promise?
0x00000081 We were hoping to initiate contact with another species! Will you complete your mission on ~mission_target_star~ system? All relevant data should be available in your Mission Log.
0x00000082 Where is the being from star system ~mission_target_star~ that you promised to bring us? Your Mission Log should have all necessary information. Will you finish your assignment, or have you become subject to irrational impulses?
0x00000083 Whatever happened to the alien from ~mission_target_star~ system? Isn't there something in your Mission Log about your bringing us one of them?
0x00000084 Where is the citizen of ~mission_target_star~ system? Our factories are standing idle! Could you not find your way? Consult your Mission Log if you're uncertain what to do.
0x0000003D Where is the being from ~mission_target_star~ system? We are impatient to begin the interrogation. Your Mission Log should have all necessary information.
0x0000003E Where's the alien from ~mission_target_star~ system? You're not going to make us evaluate its spiritual capacity from the psychic plane, are you? Check your Mission Log if you're unclear on the details.
0x0000010D Where is the creature from ~mission_target_star~ system? We have uploaded all necessary information into your Mission Log.
0x0000010E Where's the native of ~mission_target_star~ system? All mission parameters are in your Mission Log.
0x0000004B I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000004C Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000004D Also...
0x0000004E One more thing...
0x0000004F I give up.
0x00000050 I need to decline this task.
0x00000051 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000052 I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000053 I've got it this time. Farewell!
0x00000054 Thank you again. So long.
0x00000055 I will return shortly... this time for real. So long.
0x00000056 The task is well overdue. I am off!
0x00000043 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You were really intimidated by such smokestack-industry technology? You're weaker than we thought.
0x00000044 In order to drive you off the infidels must have been inspired by demons! Our military will punish them in due course. In the meantime, go in peace. 
0x00000045 You have failed to complete a simple mission on a planet with backward technology. While we are sure you tried your best, we will try to keep your limitations in mind when it comes to other tasks.
0x00000046 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. If we failed to explain the mission parameters in a sufficiently simple fashion, the fault no doubt is ours. Goodbye. 
0x00000047 We hate to point this out, but you failed to procure so much as a single example of a primitive species who had no way to harm you and no way to stop you doing whatever you wanted.~p~Whatever could you have been thinking?
0x00000048 Oh, dear. Were you really driven off by such backward peoples? You're really not so magnificent as we thought.~p~Perhaps you could bedeck yourselves with splendid items from our emporium and convince others you are worthy of respect.
0x00000049 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You have failed at this simple mission. We shall re-evaluate your reliability... and your chance of survival. Goodbye. 
0x0000004A You failed to bring us the alien! How can we introduce it to spirit circles and chanting now?
0x0000010F Your utter incapacity is noted.
0x00000110 You couldn't find planet ~mission_target_planet~? You couldn't find one of the natives? What's the problem?
0x00000060 I'm sorry. Can we discuss something else...
0x00000061 Yes, there were complications...
0x00000062 This wasn't my best work...
0x00000063 Let's focus on the future...
0x00000085 I need to move on. Farewell.
0x00000064 I beg your understanding.
0x00000086 We thank you! Once you arrive at planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have ~mission_time~ sectons to return.
0x00000087 Truly you walk in the Way of Spode. Once at planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have ~mission_time~ sectons to return.
0x00000088 Thank you. Please try to maintain plausible deniability in undertaking this mission.~p~Once at planet ~mission_target_planet~ we expect completion within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x00000089 Thank you. Please depart for planet ~mission_target_planet~ immediately. Once there, you have ~mission_time~ sectons to return.
0x0000008A Excellent! We'll warm up a new cell in the Alien Zoo! Come back within ~mission_time~ sectons, which begins ticking once you arrive on planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x0000008B We stand in awe of your glory. Once you arrive at planet ~mission_target_planet~, please bring us one of these creatures within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x0000008C Please leave for planet ~mission_target_planet~. Upon arrival, you have ~mission_time~ sectons to return.
0x0000008D Very good! We'll ready our best aura readers and psychics to make first contact! Alas, we may only succeed should you return within ~mission_time~ sectons. The galaxy will start counting when you arrive at ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000111 Leave for planet ~mission_target_planet~ at once. Once you arrive, we expect your return within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x00000112 Thanks, Captain! Depart at once for planet ~mission_target_planet~ and return within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x0000008E I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000008F Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000090 Also...
0x00000091 One more thing...
0x00000096 I should be off. Farewell!
0x00000097 Thank you for the opportunity. So long.
0x00000098 I will return shortly. So long.
0x00000099 The task is at hand. Farewell.
0x00000057 We'll manage it ourselves, then. Goodbye.
0x00000058 We expected little else from heathen creatures such as yourselves. Goodbye.
0x00000059 We have no right to compel you to undertake any task. Go in peace.
0x0000005A It is not for everyone to uplift our fellow sentients. Goodbye.
0x0000005B You don't want to play with the cute aliens? Oh, well. Some other time, then.
0x0000005C Very well. We'll keep the rewards for ourselves. 
0x0000005D We shall evaluate this new species in our own time, then. And in the meantime, we shall evaluate ~player_creature_name~.
0x0000005E You're not interested in the spiritual capacity of your fellow creatures? That seems short-sighted.
0x00000113 Do you reject the orders of the Grox?
0x00000114 You don't want to kidnap anybody? I guess we can't quarrel with that.
0x0000009A I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000009B Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000009C Also...
0x0000009D One more thing...
0x0000009E Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x0000009F Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000A0 We will speak again. Farewell.
0x000000A1 I beg your understanding.
0x000000A2 Your erratic behavior suggests that you should take an immediate detox.
0x000000A7 Spode sees into your hearts and knows that you are faithless and treacherous. Farewell.
0x000000AD The Grand Council is gravely disappointed. Goodbye.
0x00000065 ~player_creature_name~ are strange indeed. Goodbye.
0x00000066 What's the matter? Were the aliens ugly or something?
0x00000067 You are clearly all talk and no action. We'll just do the job ourselves.
0x00000068 Does the concept of honor mean nothing to you?
0x00000069 Perhaps once you've had a colonic, you'll feel better.
0x00000115 If your species desires death, perhaps we shall oblige.
0x00000116 You're giving up? Captain, you need to work on your consistency!
0x00000073 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000074 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000075 Also...
0x00000076 One more thing...
0x000000A3 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000A4 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000A5 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000A6 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x000000AE I beg your understanding. 
0x0000006B ...
0x000000A8 Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x000000A9 I need to review my mission.
0x000000AA The details of my mission have escaped me.
0x000000AB I'd like to review the details of my mission.
0x000000AC Restate your request. My notes are unclear.
0x000000AF Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x0000006A Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000007B Also...
0x0000007C One more thing...
0x0000007D I'd rather do something else.
0x0000007E I need to decline this task.
0x0000007F This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000080 I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000092 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x00000093 Until we speak again. So long.
0x00000094 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x00000095 I beg your understanding.
