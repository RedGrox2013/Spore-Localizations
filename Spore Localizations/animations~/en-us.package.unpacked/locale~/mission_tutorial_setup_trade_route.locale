0x00000001 We need to find another empire to trade goods with. Go find an empire willing to establish a trade route with us.~p~Completing this mission will earn you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000007 How can I do it?
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x0000000C Ooh. Sorry. I've got a thing.
0x0000000D I can't. I'm busy.
0x00000002 Locate an empire whose relationship is in good standing with us. Use the Short-Range Video Communicator to establish a trade route through Diplomacy.
0x00000022 Let's do it! Let's trade that Spice!
0x00000029 Sorry, I just remembered... I'm allergic to Spice.
0x00000033 Great job, Captain! We'll start shipping our Spice reserves right away.~p~Maybe we'll make enough money to buy out other star systems.
0x00000034 You are most welcome. Before I go...
0x0000003A Thanks! I'll see you later!
0x00000004 You haven't established a trade route yet? C'mon we have Spice to offload.~p~Make sure you improve your relationship enough before offering a trade.
0x0000004A Got it. One other thing...
0x0000004E I give up.
0x00000053 I'm off!
0x00000003 Tsk, tsk, tsk... So much Spice to move and so little time.~p~It's too bad you couldn't get a trade route established.
0x00000005 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000006 Before I go, I have other questions.

0x00000009 One more thing...
0x0000000A Sorry. I have another plan for funding. See you soon.

0x00000011 I would like to discuss something else...
0x00000013 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000016 Also...
0x00000019 One more thing...
0x0000005F I'm off! I shall return!
0x0000000F Are you sure? Our Empire could stand to benefit from galactic trade.
0x0000001A Perhaps later. But I would like to discuss something else...
0x0000001B Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000001C Also...

0x00000084 ...
0x00000026 What am I supposed to do again?
0x00000027 What's the purpose of this assignment?
0x00000028 Unexpected graviton turbulence scrambled our mission planning.
0x0000002A The exact goals of this mission were erased from our uh... systems.
0x0000002B Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x0000002C Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000002D Also...
