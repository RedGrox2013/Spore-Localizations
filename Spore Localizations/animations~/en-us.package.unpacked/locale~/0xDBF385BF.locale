0x00000006 Our military requires no more capital. We have ended trade between ~source_city_name~ and ~target_city_name~.
0x00000007 We have communed with the Source and It has spoken. We must end trade between ~source_city_name~ and ~target_city_name~.
0x00000008 Our relationship is no longer mutually beneficial. We have ended trade between ~source_city_name~ and ~target_city_name~.
0x00000009 We didn't need your money anyway.
0x0000000A Trade can only grow our might. We accept.
0x0000000B Such a partnership can only help spread our faith. We accept. 
0x0000000C Trade can only grow both our coffers. Your offer is accepted.
0x0000000D Great!
0x0000000E We do not need to trade with trifling civilizations such as yourselves. No.
0x0000000F We have pondered your offer deeply but found it lacking. No.
0x00000010 Our coffers overflow. We do not need to trade with you at this time. I'm sorry.
0x00000011 Very well.
0x00000012 Our armies require goods that ~target_city_name~ possesses in order to flourish. Let us establish a trade route. We will pay you handsomely for each trip. 
0x00000013 The good word cannot spread without avenues of commerce. Let us set up a trade route with ~target_city_name~. Each trip will earn you a tithe.
0x00000014 For our cities to grow, our economies must grow. We would like to establish a trade route with ~target_city_name~. We will send vehicles filled with our finest cargo, and will pay a tax to your city for each trip.
0x00000015 I accept your offer! Start shipments immediately!
0x00000016 I reject your offer! You can keep your tawdry goods.
0x00000017 You are not just a friend, but also a smart friend. We look forward to a long, prosperous relationship.
0x00000018 The Source smiles on your wisdom. May our cities be forever linked.
0x00000019 Excellent. Both of our cities will prosper from this deal. 
0x0000001A Agreed. Bye for now.
0x0000001B Our generals are not pleased. It is unlikely we will offer such a deal again.
0x0000001C You are a foolish leader. Your nation will not prosper.
0x0000001D We question your logic, but we are happy to take our business elsewhere.
0x0000001E Duly noted. Goodbye.
0x0000001F Our military gathers at your borders. We greet you only to mock you. 
0x00000020 We have little to say to you. Make your point.
0x00000021 Your civilization perplexes us. What are your intentions?
0x00000022 We are pleased with our relations. How can we assist you?
0x00000023 You are a fine ally. What is that you wish to speak about?
0x00000024 You have defiled our beliefs and mocked our people. What do you want?
0x00000025 The Source frowns on your people and their creations. Why do you contact us?
0x00000026 We have meditated on it for hours but cannot decide whether you are friend or foe. What do you need?
0x00000027 We believe you are a force for good in this world. What do you need?
0x00000028 The Source sings of our alliance and its power. Speak openly, friend.
0x00000029 Your existence threatens the very existence of this planet. What could you possible want from us?
0x0000002A Rarely have we seen a threat such as yours. Are you a force for good or evil?
0x0000002B What is your purpose? 
0x0000002C Greetings! Actions speak louder than words in the market, and you seem a pleasant enough neighbor at present. What do you need?
0x0000002D Great alliances such as ours will stand the test of ages! Speak your mind, neighbor.
0x0000002E Our mighty forces have taken one of your cities! Have you come to beg for the return of ~source_captured_player_city_name~?
0x0000002F Our nation continues to expand. ~source_captured_npc_city_name~ is another fine addition in our quest for dominance. What is your purpose in contacting us?
0x00000030 Your defiling of ~source_lost_city_to_player_name~ is the last of a litany of mistakes. We will not let you retain it easily. 
0x00000033 You attack us in our homes! What purpose do you have for this madness? You must know that this will not be tolerated.
0x00000034 We have conquered your pitiful city of ~source_captured_player_city_name~. Soon, it too, will understand the true meaning of our faith.
0x00000035  Our influence continues to expand! Our crusade has added the city of ~source_captured_npc_city_name~ to our nation.
0x00000036 Your pathetic attempt to break our spirits will fail. You may have captured ~source_lost_city_to_player_name~ but we will reclaim it before long.
0x00000038 You have turned against us and chosen to wage war against our people. We will not tolerate this. Prepare for war.
0x00000039 The purchase of ~source_captured_npc_city_name~ has barely scratched the surface of our ambitions. 
0x0000003A  We have purchased ~source_captured_npc_city_name~, proving that we can grow our nation without conflict.
0x0000003E There is no need for armed conflict but you have chosen to bring it to our city. We are saddened beyond reckoning. 
0x0000003F We have need of your forces. Will you fight on our behalf?
0x00000042 Our people admire your wide tracts of land.
0x00000046 Your people are descended from limbless space slugs.
0x00000051 We come offering gifts. Do you accept?
0x00000052 Goodbye
0x00000053 Your words show great wisdom.
0x00000054 Take care
0x00000055 You'll look good over my mantlepiece...
0x00000056 Whatever
0x00000057 Why, I've always counted on the kindness of strangers...
0x00000058 We appreciate your efforts to improve relations.
0x00000059 My pleasure
0x0000005A Yes, please. Thanks in advance!
0x0000005B Well, what can you give us?
0x0000005C Here's 4000 Sporebucks...
0x0000005D Here's 2000 Sporebucks...
0x0000005E Here's 1000 Sporebucks...
0x0000005F Nevermind
0x00000060 This planet trembles before our mighty armada. You will not survive. Prepare for war.
0x00000061 The world must unite around the one true Faith. You will learn the Truth as all those before you have learned.
0x00000062 The time for communication and trade is at an end. Prepare for war.
0x00000063 I'm sorry, did you say something?
0x00000064 Okay, bully. We surrender. Hope you like the mess you've made of ~target_city_name~.
0x00000065 Bye
0x00000066 Your religion has gained popularity in ~target_city_name~! We have no choice but to convert to your culture. Now spread the good word to other cities!
0x00000067 Bye
0x00000068 ~target_city_name~ was a cakewalk to defeat. Hope you're better able to defend yourself next time!
0x00000069 Bye
0x0000006A Was it the song? Was it the music? We're not sure, but your citizens have decided that ~target_city_name~ will be joining our nation. Sorry, but charm like this is hard to contain.
0x0000006B Bye
0x0000006C Hey, we captured ~target_city_name~, woohoo!
0x0000006D Hope you're ready for us, ~target_city_name~ is ours now.
0x0000006E ~target_city_name~ will make a fine addition to our empire!
0x0000006F ~target_city_name~ falls before our might!
0x00000070 Good for you.
0x00000071 We would like to offer ~offer_1~ Sporebucks for ~target_city_name~. Interested?
0x00000072 We understand why you would want fair ~target_city_name~ for your own! Name your price.
0x00000073 ~offer_1~ Sporebucks
0x00000074 ~offer_2~ Sporebucks
0x00000075 ~offer_3~ Sporebucks
0x00000076 ~offer_4~ Sporebucks
0x00000077 ~offer_5~ Sporebucks
0x00000078 Nevermind...
0x00000079 Thanks for wasting our time.
0x0000007A Sorry.
0x0000007B You are a very generous bidder. We gladly accept your offer.
0x0000007C Yay!
0x0000007D You are a shrewd negotiator. We accept.
0x0000007E Yay!
0x0000007F After due consideration we must inform you that your offer has been rejected.
0x00000080 Oops.
0x00000081 You insult my parents and my parents' parents. Such a ridiculous offer cannot be tolerated.
0x00000082 Oops.
0x00000083 Hi, ~target_city_name~ of the ~player_name_nation~ here, what news do you bring?
0x00000084 Time to monopolize this planet.
0x00000085 Time to spread the Truth across this planet.
0x00000086 Time to conquer this planet.
0x00000087 We can see the writing on the wall. I think it's time to fight no more forever.
0x00000088 We happily accept your surrender.
0x00000089 We've won! Let's band together, so the world can live as one.
0x0000008A I'd hoped someday you'd join us.
0x0000008B It's time to show us proper respect. We demand ~offer_1~ Sporebucks.
0x0000008C Very well - we wouldn't want to lose this alliance.
0x0000008D You can have the money - once you pry it from our dead, cold hands.
0x0000008E You have chosen wisely.
0x0000008F Don't push it, buddy...
0x00000090 We are not pleased.
0x00000091 You are wasting your breath.
0x00000092 We are upset that you are trading with ~npc1_name_nation~. We insist that you stop immediately!
0x00000093 We understand. We'll cut them off.
0x00000094 Well, if you would cover our loses with 4000 Sporebucks...
0x00000095 Sorry. We don't consider this to be prudent at this juncture.
0x00000096 Thank you, we appreciate your support.
0x00000097 Excellent. Goodbye.
0x00000098 We can do that. Glad to see we could make a deal.
0x00000099 Thank you. Goodbye.
0x0000009A We're disappointed to hear that.
0x0000009B It's our final decision. Goodbye.
0x0000009C We could use your help. Would you declare war on ~npc1_name_nation~?
0x0000009D Absolutely. We're happy to join with you.
0x0000009E Hmmm... maybe if you sweeten the deal with 2000 Sporebucks?
0x0000009F Sorry. We don't consider this to be prudent at this juncture.
0x000000A0 Excellent. Let's grind our enemies into dust!
0x000000A1 Huzzah!
0x000000A2 Sounds good. Glad to have you on our side.
0x000000A3 Let's go!
0x000000A4 I'm sorry to hear that.
