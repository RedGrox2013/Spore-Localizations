0x00000003 Hey there! While you've been flying around in that spaceship, we've been analyzing everything you've seen and scanned. One thing is becoming very clear: space is a lot larger than we thought!~p~It's clear that a few little colonies are not going to cut it. We're going to need resources, and we're going to need a wide base of operations.~p~Controlling ~mission_badge_needed_total~ different star systems will be a good start.
0x00000007 All right. I can manage that.
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x00000002 You're on your own for acquiring the Colony Incredi-Paks. They're not cheap and Mission Control can't afford to hand them out like candy.~p~Mmmmm, candy. Is it lunch time yet?
0x00000022 Not a problem.
0x00000029 Reject
0x00000033 Excellent work! With all these colonies to harvest resources, we've put our empire in a strong position. But that doesn't mean we're done... this is just the beginning! This empire has got to keep growing if we're going to explore the whole galaxy.
0x00000034 Yippee! Before I go...
0x0000003A I'm off for more adventures!
0x00000004 Back so soon? There's still a whole galaxy out there, and we don't control anywhere near enough of it!~p~Every minute spent here is a minute wasted. Head back into space and keep colonizing until we control ~mission_badge_needed_total~ different star systems.
0x0000004A Got it. One other thing...
0x0000004E Keep the training fee... but I'm dropping out.
0x00000053 Now you see me, now you don't.
0x0000000E Fantastic! Just head back out into the galaxy and visit planets on different stars. When you find a reasonable plot of land, use the colony tool from your Colonization tool bin. Everything after that is completely automated.~p~Remember, we need colonies on at least ~mission_badge_needed_total~ different star systems. Space is big, so we need to go big, too!
0x00000005 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000005F Now you see me, now you don't.
0x0000000F Not interested in helping your species become the greatest, most fantastic, super duper Empire in the entire galaxy?~p~Too bad, we were planning on baking you a cake. I'll tell them to stop.
0x0000006B I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000071 Now you see me, now you don't.
0x00000010 You're going to quit now? But our plan for galaxy expansion is not complete.
0x00000006 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000007E Now you see me, now you don't.
0x00000084 ...
0x00000008 I'm supposed to do what, now?
0x00000009 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000085 Now you see me, now you don't.
0x00000011 Colonize ~mission_badge_needed_left~ more star ~^p^mission_badge_needed_left^system^systems~.
0x00000012 Return home to complete mission.
0x00000013 Use your Colony Incredi-Pak to colonize a planet.
0x00000014 Mission Control is looking forward to the good news.
0x00000016 Place colonies on ~mission_badge_needed_total~ unique star systems to expand your Empire. Placing colonies is not the only way to secure additonal colonized planets. You can conquer other Empire planets or you can establish trade routes, which will lead to the ability to purchase them.~p~Once you've completed your mission, return to your homeworld.~p~Completing this mission will earn you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000017 Congratulations! Return home to complete your mission.
