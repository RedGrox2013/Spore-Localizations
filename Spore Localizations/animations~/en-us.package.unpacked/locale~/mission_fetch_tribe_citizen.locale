0x00000007 It is a mission of our federation to discover intelligent life forms and raise them to the level of our own civilization. Would you aid us in this endeavor?
0x00000008 A probe has recently returned from planet ~mission_target_planet~ with evidence that a species there may have developed intelligent life. As our covenant clearly expresses a desire to bring all intelligent species under the protection of the Grand Council, we would like to find out more about these beings before approaching them formally. Can you investigate for us?
0x00000009 Our federation desires uplift and education for all intelligent species. A new intelligent species may have been discovered at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Could you help us find out more about them?
0x0000000A A wandering trader recently sold us some artifacts that she claims came from an undiscovered intelligent species. We are skeptical, but our xeno-anthropologists would very much like to analyze any new sentient species, if it exists. Would you be willing to help us verify the existence of this species? 
0x0000000B One of our probes to planet ~mission_target_planet~ was destroyed shortly after landing by natives armed with rocks and sticks. Are you willing to help us find out more about this new species?
0x0000000C One of our ships transiting star system ~mission_target_star~ chanced to observe evidence of a primitive species living on one of its worlds. Would you help discover if this species possesses intelligence?

0x0000000E A new form of intelligent life may have arisen on planet ~mission_target_planet~. We're all mesmerized by the tribal lifestyle, with all the drums and maracas and nose-flutes and dancing. Can you bring one of these people here, so that we can enjoy the fascination of the primitive up close?
0x0000000F A new race has risen from the slime of planet ~mission_target_planet~! Since we're always looking for new people to party with, maybe you can fetch one of these beings in time for our next soiree. What do you think?
0x00000010 We've discovered the home world of a new intelligent species! Would it be too much trouble for a being of your magnificence to pop over to star system ~mission_target_star~ and fetch one of these primitive creatures? We will make it worth your time. 
0x00000011 Good news! Our stock is rising because we have discovered a potential new market! A species in the ~mission_target_star~ system is believed to have developed intelligence! ~p~Surely a being of your experience would know how to bring us one of these creatures, in exchange for rewards?
0x00000012 On an insignificant planet in the ~mission_target_star~ system, nature has worked one of its wonders! A creature there has evolved into a species of intelligence that needs to learn about our products! Will you help us prepare our Ad campaign? Rich rewards are a certainty
0x00000013 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems to be the home of a tribal species. We're fascinated to discover if these beings have any exciting, primitive ceremonies we can adapt. Will you bring us one so we can ask it to dance for us?
0x00000014 Some of us yearn to forsake the material life by living in grass huts, hunting and gathering, and shaking maracas. Unfortunately, we don't have anyone to teach us the necessary skills, so we wonder if you can fetch us one of the tribal people from planet ~mission_target_planet~ to be our teacher?
0x00000015 We admire the profound spiritual simplicity of those who live close to nature. As a tribal people live on planet ~mission_target_planet~, we'd like to adopt one of these as our teacher. Will you visit this world and bring us a suitable candidate?
0x00000016 We've discovered that a species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ has developed intelligence. These might make useful mercenaries. Can you help us evaluate them?

0x00000018 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ turns out to possess a primitive species. We might want to brush them aside and take their world for our own, but they may prove tenacious. Can you conduct a reconnaissance for us?
0x00000151 An intelligent organic species has been discovered on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Bring us one for evaluation. 
0x00000152 We desire a specimen from planet ~mission_target_planet~. You will bring this to us.
0x00000153 It is necessary to know whether the dominant species of planet ~mission_target_planet~ constitutes a threat. You will aid us in this evaluation.
0x00000154 A passing trader told us of a tribal species on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Maybe they'd be our allies if we helped them out! 
0x00000155 It's possible that the dominant species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ may possess intelligence. Will you help us find out?
0x00000156 A trader showed us some primitive tools that came from planet ~mission_target_planet~. We'd like to find out more about this world.
0x00000019 How can I find it?
0x0000001A I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x0000001B Ooh. Sorry. I've got a thing.
0x0000001C I can't. I'm busy.
0x00000046 I regret that I must decline.
0x0000001D A species on planet ~mission_target_planet~, near the ~mission_target_star~ system, has developed what seems to be a tribal society. It is impossible at this time to know whether they will bring destruction to their environment, or will live in harmony with it. We'd like to evaluate their intelligence, so if you could travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and bring us a member of ~mission_item~, we'd be grateful.
0x0000001E Creatures on planet ~mission_target_planet~ are living in a way that suggests intelligence. Travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~, take a member of ~mission_item~, then return here so that the creature may be evaluated by our theologians.
0x0000001F A new species has been discovered on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Please travel there and acquire a member of ~mission_item~, then return here so that the individual may be studied by our scientists.
0x00000020 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ orbits star system ~mission_target_star~. Travel to this world, and if the natives' behavior suggests intelligence, take one of these creatures and bring it here for further evaluation. 
0x00000021 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ orbits the ~mission_target_star~ system. Go there and bring us a member of ~mission_item~. From there, it'll be nothing but fun! 
0x00000022 A species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems to have developed enough intelligence to welcome the arrival of traders bent on improving their level of happiness. Please travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and acquire a member of ~mission_item~, then return here so that the individual may be studied by our marketing experts.
0x00000023 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ circles the ~mission_target_star~ system. Please travel there and bring us a member of ~mission_item~ so we can examine its aura.
0x00000024 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ orbits the ~mission_target_star~ system. Take one example from the dirty, hut-dwelling species who lives there and bring it here for evaluation. 
0x00000157 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ orbits the ~mission_target_star~ system. Go there, acquire a member of the dominant species, and return. 
0x00000158 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ orbits star system ~mission_target_star~. Travel there, acquire a member of the dominant species, and return without delay. 
0x00000025 Sounds awesome! I would love to. 
0x0000004A This seems doable. I accept!
0x0000005F I will do what you bid.
0x00000029 Ewwww... No way. 
0x0000006B No thank you, save it for yourself! 
0x00000071 I am sorry, forgive me I regret that I must decline.
0x0000002E You have returned to your people victorious! This ~mission_item~ clearly establishes the ~race~ as players on the intergalactic stage! For your efforts, please accept ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000002F Look everyone - the handsome and fearless astro-hero has returned with the ~mission_item~! Doesn't he look great? We are so lucky to have your face associated with our products. Anyway, here is your commission of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks for your exemplary work.
0x00000030 *Gasp*!!! The ~mission_item~ specimen - you have it! Inconceivable! We have halted all non-critical experiments for an hour to express our appreciation. Please accept the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks we owe you.
0x00000031 ~player_creature_name~. That could have been quicker! Is your navigation incompetent? You got the ~mission_item~? Hey, it's slightly scuffed! Is that chipped paint? What's this stain? Well, I guess it's not *completely* ruined - here's ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000032 O, noble and intrepid explorer - you have brought us the ~mission_item~! The people of ~planet_name~ have retired to their parlor-rooms, eager to compose sonnets and song of your most heroic travails! Our payment of ~mission_rewards~ Spucks alone is not adequate tribute. Perhaps you will come to our open mic night next month?
0x00000033 ~player_creature_name~. ChkChkChk. Specimen obtained. ~mission_item~ transfer to ~race~ complete. Payment tendered - ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. Business Concluded. End.
0x00000026 Already it seems clear that this species will have a part to play in the galactic natural order. We're happy to offer you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x00000027 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Our theologians will begin the examination of the creature at once. We thank you for your efforts, and offer you these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. Of course you will tithe some of it back to Spode's Temple?
0x00000028 Thanks to you, our mission of civilization may continue. The Grand Council has authorized me to award you the Certificate of Merit, Third Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000002A ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Our Xeno-anthropologists are delighted with the species you have brought us. In return, please accept these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. Would you like to join us at the dissection, or does business take you elsewhere?
0x0000002B The primitive alien has shown to be a lot of fun! He has exactly the same susceptibility to intoxicants that we do! Here, have some ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks!
0x0000002C Our preliminary inspection reveals that the new species is willing to sign over vast natural resources in return for access to our entertainment broadcasts! Please enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and don't leave without a visit to our bazaar.
0x0000002D ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. The ~mission_item~ spends all his time wailing, moaning, and running in hopeless circles! He's clearly expressing compassion for our technologically advanced, materialistic lifestyles, and will make us a terrific teacher. How wonderful! Please take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks!
0x00000034 ~player_creature_name~. We appreciate your promptness. We shall evaluate this new species as soon as possible. In the meantime, please take ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000159 ~player_creature_name~. Your mission was completed successfully, with the specimen in good condition. You may have your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000015A Excellent job, Captain! We'll begin examining the alien immediately. Enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks!
0x00000035 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000036 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000037 Also...
0x00000038 One more thing...
0x00000039 A pleasure to help. So long.
0x0000003A No trouble at all. Farewell.
0x0000003B Anytime. See you later.
0x0000003C You are most generous. 
0x00000081 Weren't you going to help us in acquiring a member of ~mission_item~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~? All data is available in your Mission Log... perhaps you should consult it. 
0x00000082 You have not brought us a member of ~mission_item~? All information is available in your Mission Log. Do you plan to keep your word?
0x00000083 You have not furnished the member of ~mission_item~, as you agreed to do. Verification of the agreement will be provided by your Mission Log. Will you complete this assignment?
0x00000085 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Despite the agreement recorded in your Mission Log, we have yet to see our specimen? Is it possible that the primitive ~mission_item~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~ are capable of outwitting your race?
0x00000086 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Where's the fascinating primitive from planet ~mission_target_planet~? All information is available in your Mission Log. We had planned such fun!
0x00000087 Where is the ~mission_item~? Will you bring it soon? Has the necessary data been erased from your Mission Log?
0x0000003D ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We yearn for the soulful simplicity of ~mission_item~! Where is he? All the necessary specifications should be in your Mission Log. 
0x0000003E You have failed to bring us a specimen from planet ~mission_target_planet~, despite the solemn agreement recorded in your Mission Log. Are they too wily for you, or is there some other reason why you haven't performed as you have agreed?
0x0000015B Even though parameters were uploaded into your Mission Log, you have not yet returned with a member of ~mission_target_species~. Will you obey our directive? 
0x0000015C Where's the alien? Have you erased the specifications from your Mission Log? 
0x0000004B I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000004C Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000004D Also...
0x0000004E One more thing...
0x0000004F I give up.
0x00000050 I need to decline this task.
0x00000051 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000052 I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000053 I've got it this time. Farewell!
0x00000054 Thank you again. So long.
0x00000055 I will return shortly... this time for real. So long.
0x00000056 The task is well overdue. I am off!
0x0000003F They drove you off with their sticks and rocks? We'll try to survive our disappointment. Goodbye.
0x00000040 These natives are obviously inspired by demonic powers! Or... are you in league with the demons yourselves?
0x00000041 The Grand Council finds it extraordinary that you could not return with a single member of a primitive species. We wish you greater success in the future. Farewell. 
0x00000042 If you failed to bring ~mission_item~, your brains are obviously more primitive than we thought. We shall adjust our calculations accordingly. 
0x00000043 Defeated by primitives living in huts? The universe isn't going to be kind to you, you know.
0x00000044 You were thwarted by a primitive species? We had better hopes for you. Goodbye. 
0x00000045 Oh, we completely understand! The spiritually advanced primitives taught you a valuable lesson by defeating you in such a humiliating way!
0x00000047 ~player_creature_name~. You have failed to find members of a species that live in huts and can't possibly harm you. ~p~Your military capacity is noted.
0x0000015D ~player_creature_name~. You failed to bring ~mission_target_species~. Your incapacity seems unique in the galaxy. 
0x0000015E And here we thought that taking a modern, well-equipped starship to fetch a stone-age alien would be a snap!
0x00000048 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000049 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000088 Can I ask about something else?
0x00000091 One more thing...
0x00000096 I need to move on. Farewell.
0x00000064 Sorry, I must go now. 
0x00000097 I beg your understanding.
0x00000098 Thank you! You will play your part in raising this species to enlightenment!
0x00000099 Go with Spode. 
0x0000009A In the name of our civilization, we thank you. Please leave at once.
0x0000009B Thank you! Our xeno-anthropologists are highly stimulated by the possibility of being able to categorize another species!
0x0000009C Oh, excellent! We'll start spreading out the party bowls!
0x0000009D Splendid! Rewards shall be showered upon you!
0x0000009E Splendid! You're so wonderful for helping us to become more wonderful!
0x00000057 Your willingness is appreciated. 
0x0000015F Begin at once. 
0x00000160 Great! We'll look forward to our encounter with this new species!
0x00000073 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000074 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000075 Also...
0x00000076 One more thing...
0x00000077 I should be off. Farewell!
0x00000078 Thank you for the opportunity. So long.
0x00000079 I will return shortly. So long.
0x0000007A The task is at hand. Farewell.
0x00000058 You won't? Farewell, then. 
0x00000059 Those who reject Spode's divine design will suffer throughout eternity. Goodbye.
0x0000005A The Grand Council realizes that not every species is curious about other forms of intelligent life. Farewell.
0x0000005B In that case, we'll obtain the specimen ourselves. Goodbye.
0x0000005C You don't want to play with ~mission_item~? Don't you have any curiosity at all?
0x0000005D If you aren't curious about this new species, perhaps you will be curious about our boutique? 
0x0000005E You don't want to make contact with a spiritually evolved ~mission_item~? How shortsighted of you.
0x00000060 Perhaps you are wise to avoid matching wits with this primitive species.
0x00000161 Do you lack the capacity to understand a command when you hear one?
0x00000162 You won't go? Do you have a problem with kidnapping or something?
0x00000089 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000008A Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000008B Also...
0x0000008C One more thing...
0x0000008D Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x0000008E Perhaps another time. So long.
0x0000008F We will speak again. Farewell.
0x00000090 I beg your understanding.
0x00000061 Your behavior exhibits symptoms of a disordered mind.
0x00000062 Oath-breakers shall suffer the Wrath of Spode. Goodbye. 
0x00000063 You are abandoning this simple mission? We shall reconsider our evaluation of your species. Goodbye.
0x000000A7 Previously eccentric, your behavior now seems bizarre. Goodbye.
0x00000065 Silly alien!
0x00000066 Kidnapping a primitive from his hut? How hard could that be?
0x00000067 You must have taken a twisted metaphysical path to reach this point in your history. 
0x00000068 On your appearance, the universe must have wept.
0x00000163 A death wish is prominent in your species, we observe.
0x00000164 You're giving up? Did the alien throw a rock at you or something?
0x0000009F I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000A0 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000A1 Also...
0x000000A2 One more thing...
0x000000A3 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000A4 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000A5 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000A6 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x000000AD I beg your understanding. 
0x00000084 ...
0x000000A8 Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x000000A9 I need to review my mission.
0x000000AA The details of my mission have escaped me.
0x000000AB I'd like to review the details of my mission.
0x000000AC Restate your request. My notes are unclear.
0x000000AE Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x0000006A Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000007B Also...
0x0000007C One more thing...
0x0000007D I'd rather do something else.
0x0000007E I need to decline this task.
0x0000007F This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000080 I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000092 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x00000093 Until we speak again. So long.
0x00000094 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x00000095 I beg your understanding.
