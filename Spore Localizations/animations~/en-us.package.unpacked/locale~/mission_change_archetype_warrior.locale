0x00000001 ~player_creature_name~ ask to learn the Philosophy of Force. ~player_creature_name~ wish to stand with the great warriors. To call upon Force is to have friends in battle. The power of Raider Rally can summon aid in combat. There is much strength in friends.~p~~player_creature_name~ must understand that the training is hard. To act with Force, one must be strong. One must be tough. One must commit completely.
0x00000007 I understand.  Please continue.
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x00000002 The Philosophy of Force is not easily followed. ~player_creature_name~ must show commitment. There is no strength without commitment.~p~~player_creature_name~ will pay ~mission_accept_cost~ Sporebucks and when complete, must give up other super power. Only then will we ~race~ teach the Philosophy of Force.
0x00000022 I am willing to commit.  Please teach me.
0x00000029 I've changed my mind. I will stay as I am for now.
0x0000000E Training begins, ~player_creature_name~. The Philosophy of Force is driven by strength and courage. Show us your strength. Show us your courage. Conquer ~mission_num_actions_left_to_perform~ planets. Then we will grant you the power of Raider Rally.
0x00000003 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000005F I'm off!
0x0000000F Very well, ~player_creature_name~.  Return when you are able to show your commitment.
0x0000006B Can we discuss something else...
0x00000071 I'm off!
0x00000033 ~player_creature_name~, you have done well! You have proven your strength. Your training is complete. We are honored to give you the power of Raider Rally.
0x00000034 The honor is mine. I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000003A I am off to use the power of Raider Rally on the enemy!
0x00000004 ~player_creature_name~ must conquer ~mission_num_actions_left_to_perform~ more ~^p^mission_num_actions_left_to_perform^planet^planets~. Only then will the ~race~ be satisfied with your strength.
0x0000004A Got it. One other thing...
0x0000004E Please cancel my training, even though I already paid.
0x00000053 I'm off!
0x00000010 Perhaps the ~race~ were wrong to train you.  You lack strength.
0x00000005 Can we discuss something else...
0x0000007E Sorry. I'm off!
0x00000084 ...
0x00000006 Please remind me how to complete my training.
0x00000008 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000009 I'm off!
0x00000011 Conquer ~mission_num_actions_left_to_perform~ more ~^p^mission_num_actions_left_to_perform^planet^planets~.
0x00000012 Your training is complete! 
0x00000013 By Conquering the planets, you will learn the Philosophy of Force.
0x00000014 Return to star system ~mission_source_star~ for your reward! 
0x00000016 To complete your training in the Philosophy of Force, demonstrate your strength by conquering ~mission_num_actions_left_to_perform~ more ~^p^mission_num_actions_left_to_perform^planet^planets~.
0x00000017 Your Philosophy of Force training is complete! Return to the ~mission_source_star~ star system!
