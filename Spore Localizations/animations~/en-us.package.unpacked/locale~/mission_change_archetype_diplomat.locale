0x00000001 Ah yes, most welcome friend. So you say you would like to join us in the Philosophy of Order? Very good, as we are sure you know this is no easy task. Only those dedicated to making order from chaos will feel at home. There are many, many forms to fill out, signatures required, fees to collect, and approvals to obtain.~p~Of course it should be stated, Galactic Policy is that you may only control one super power at a time. If you train with us, you will have to relinquish your current super power. Understand?
0x00000007 Yes. I would like to hear more...
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x00000002 Of course, we follow the Scrolls of Order. With their tidy margins and neatly numbered passages... Makes us giddy just thinking about the double-spacing!~p~We have one super power at our disposal and it is only to be used with a proper license. We call it... Static Cling. With Static Cling, turrets will not fire at you or your allied fleet for a certain amount of time. Very useful indeed.~p~And speaking of allies, forming relationships is the key to your training in the Philosophy of Order.~p~What say you? Ready to pay your tuition of ~mission_accept_cost~ Sporebucks?
0x00000022 I accept your Philosophy and wish to begin my training.
0x00000029 I've changed my mind. I will stay as I am for now.
0x00000033 Welcome back, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~! We see you have completed your training and are therefore accepted into the Philosophy of Order!~p~The papers have been filed and everything is set and approved, just as it should be. ~p~Welcome to the fray. Static Cling is now yours.
0x00000034 Yippee! I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000003A I'm off to try Static Cling! Farewell!
0x00000004 You have not yet completed your course of instruction. Further work is required.
0x0000004A Got it. One other thing...
0x0000004E Keep the training fee... but I'm dropping out.
0x00000053 Roger. The starship ~ufo_name~ out.
0x0000000E Excellent. Your application for enrollment, and fee, have been accepted. In this case, we will waive the paperwork. You need to sign and set to work immediately in your task.~p~You must form ~mission_num_actions_left_to_perform~ new alliances. We are sure you understand how important interstellar relationships are. When we open the pathways of communication, we cut down on diplomatic errors. It is of the utmost importance.
0x00000003 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000005F Roger. The starship ~ufo_name~ out.
0x0000000F Very well.~p~The Grand Council invites you to reapply to the Philosophy of Order at a later date, to be determined by the applicant.
0x0000006B I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000071 Roger. The starship ~ufo_name~ out.
0x00000010 Very well. If you could please submit your request to terminate your training, in writing, we will prepare the paperwork to void your apprentice status.
0x00000005 I'll get right on that. One other thing...
0x0000007E Roger. The starship ~ufo_name~ out.
0x0000000A ...
0x00000006 I need to review our training agreement.
0x00000008 I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000009 Roger. The starship ~ufo_name~ out.
0x00000011 Form ~mission_num_actions_left_to_perform~ new ~^p^mission_num_actions_left_to_perform^alliance^alliances~.
0x00000012 Your training is complete! 
0x00000013 To complete your training in the Philosophy of Order, you must spread diplomacy and peace throughout the galaxy.
0x00000014 Return to the ~mission_source_star~ star system!
0x00000016 To train in the Philosophy of Order, you need to form ~mission_num_actions_left_to_perform~ more new ~^p^mission_num_actions_left_to_perform^alliance^alliances~.~p~This will earn you the defensive ability Static Cling. 
0x00000017 Your Philosophy of Order training is complete! Return to the ~mission_source_star~ star system!
