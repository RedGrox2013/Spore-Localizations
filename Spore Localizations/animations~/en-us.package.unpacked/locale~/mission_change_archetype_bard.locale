0x00000001 Ahoy! You want to join our fateful crew! We are sure there's a lot for you to do.~br~We know we are incredibly jolly, if you fail to join us that is your folly!~br~It won't be easy on that you can bet! But you can probably get through it not soaking wet!!~p~Ho ho! We crack ourselves up. ~p~Seriously though, it ain't gonna be easy! And... it's gonna cost ya! ~mission_accept_cost~ Spucks, in fact!~p~To take on the Philosophy of Chance is to give up your old super power in exchange for the new... so, be sure of what you do.
0x00000003 You want to be like us, the ~race~??? Well, well! That is a big commitment, you know. It is a big decision that you should spend a proper amount of time thinking about.~p~TIMES UP!~p~Hoohoo! Just kidding! But you will have to give up your super power in exchange for ours, you will need to adhere to the Philosophy of Chance, and pay the tiny little tuition fee of ~mission_accept_cost~ Spucks.~p~What say you, oh Serious One...? Ready to take a chance on Chance? If you ask us though... it would be a step up for you!
0x00000007 Tell me more. I'm fascinated!
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x00000002 Those that follow the Philosophy of Chance, such as the adorable ~race~...Who us? Why, thank you! Don't mention it!... *ahem*... Love the unexpected and the twists and turns of life. The meaning of life is both simple and complex... is it not? No, I think it is.~p~But most importance is happiness... That, and surprises... And also cake.~p~To sing and make merry is our favorite ritual and by this we have invented a very special song... the Soothing Song. That is our super power! It makes even your worst enemy friendly... until it wears off. Wowsers!~p~Will you be joining us in our song?
