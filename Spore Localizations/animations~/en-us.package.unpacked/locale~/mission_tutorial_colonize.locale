0x0000000E We need to expand our Empire and our wealth by building colonies on other planets, for mining resources.~p~We've drafted a few volunteers to be part of the Colony Incredi-Pak, which we've placed in your Colonization bin. Our astronomers have been observing the heavens and have identified a hospitable planet, ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000016 Okay. How do I establish a colony?
0x00000017 I'll explore space on my own.
0x0000001B Excellent! Placing a colony is easy.~p~After flying to planet ~mission_target_planet~, select the colony tool that has been added to your Colonization tool bin and place the colony on land, near a spice geyser.~p~It will instantly unpack, creating a colony. No assembly required.~p~You might want to make contact with the colony to make sure the citizens we packed in there, unpacked safely.
0x0000000F One more thing before I go...
0x00000010 Oh, one more thing...
0x00000011 Hey, one other thing...
0x0000001C I will make the Empire proud! So long!
0x0000001D I won't return until planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been colonized!
0x0000001E I won't fail you! Farewell!
0x0000001F Totally! I'm just the dude for the job!
0x00000020 Once again, excellent work, Captain!~p~Our empire will one day dominate the galaxy.~p~We'll be counting on you to visit this colony frequently to collect the spice it produces.~p~Our scientists are busy researching new technologies to improve the Terrascores of planets, which will one day help to improve conditions on our new colony planet.~p~In the meantime, we have more pressing matters to attend to. Are you ready to continue?
0x0000002C I'm in.
0x00000028 Captain ~player_creature_name~! Have you lost your marbles?~p~We must colonize planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~Place a colony, ideally in an area that is on land and near Spice geysers.
0x00000029 Okay, Okay. One more thing before I go...
0x0000002A And another thing...
0x0000002B There was one other thing...
0x00000030 I got it! Wish me luck!
0x00000031 Okay, I think I understand!
0x00000032 Colonize near Spice geysers. Got it.
0x00000033 Of course!
0x00000034 Oh I knew THAT! I was just kidding!
0x00000001 Are you sure? Expansion of our empire will be an economic boon for our society, and the cost of space flight will drop as well.~p~At the same time, leg-room and the in-flight beverage selections will increase!
0x00000012 I'd like to discuss something else...
0x00000002 Maybe later.
0x00000003 Not now, I'm busy.
0x00000004 Maybe in a bit.
0x00000005 I'll be back when I'm ready to colonize.
0x00000035 No luck Captain...? That's disappointing, but don't despair.~p~Better luck next time.
0x00000039 I'd like to discuss something else...
0x0000003C Sorry. I'll be back.
0x0000003D Yes, I was a bit distracted. So long for now
0x0000003F Goodbye, for now.
0x00000040 The Empire does not favor those who lack the mettle to do its bidding. Your failings of tenacity shall be noted. Our people will talk of your shortcomings.
0x00000013 I'd like to discuss something else...
0x00000041 I can take it.
0x00000042 Nothing I haven't heard before.
0x00000043 Maybe you should get over it.
0x00000044 Next time, try a little respect!
0x00000045 ...
0x00000046 What am I supposed to do again?
0x00000047 What's the purpose of this assignment?
0x00000048 Unexpected graviton turbulence scrambled our mission planning.
0x00000049 The exact goals of this mission were erased from our uh... systems.
0x0000000D Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x0000006A Before I go, I have other questions...
0x0000007B Also...
0x0000007C One more thing...
0x0000007D I'd rather do something else.
0x0000007F This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000092 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x00000093 Until we speak again. So long.
0x00000094 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x0000001A Okay. Here is another one that you can use to install a colony. This is going to cost you ~tool_cost~ Sporebucks.~p~This time be more careful.
0x00000021 We'd give you another Colony Incredi-Pak, but it costs ~tool_cost~ Sporebucks and you don't seem to have enough.~p~Come back when you have enough Sporebucks.
0x00000022 One more thing before I go...
0x00000023 Oh, one more thing...
0x00000024 Hey, one other thing...
0x00000025 Understood. Thanks!
