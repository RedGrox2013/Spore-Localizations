0x00000022 How can I find it?
0x00000023 Nah. I'm just not into this mission.
0x00000024 No, thanks. I'll pass.
0x00000025 I don't think I'm a good fit for this.
0x00000026 I beg for your understanding, I cannot accept this mission. 
0x00000027 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ can be found orbiting the star called ~mission_target_star~.~p~If you complete this task without incident, you will receive ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. ~p~For internal purposes, we've coded this mission as 'Need to Know Basis'. As long as you acquire this powder for us, we don't need to know how you got it. ~p~Got it?
0x00000028 Right on, buddy! Let's put you to work! ~p~We need you to get yourself to the ~mission_target_star~ star system, just as fast as the ~ufo_name~ will go. ~p~Then, go to planet ~mission_target_planet~, and you get us the ~mission_item~. ~p~You may encounter... obstacles. But hey, we're sure a big clever space hero like you will be able to figure something out. ~p~The mission's worth ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. How 'bout it?
0x00000029 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in the ~mission_target_star~ system. ~p~You should be able to find the ~mission_item~ there. ~p~We're so fed up with being pushed around the galaxy, we don't care how you get it. Just get it! ~p~We'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. ~p~Could you... that is... would you... please help us? Please?
0x0000002A You'll be able to find planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system. ~p~This mission is crucial to our overtly hostile and aggressive way of life, so we'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks to get us the stuff at any cost. ~p~We all derive so much pleasure from making lesser Empires and Civilizations suffer before us! This ~mission_item~ stuff could level the playing field and wreck everything we stand for!!!
0x0000002B You shall find planet ~mission_target_planet~ ceaselessly orbiting its parent star, ~mission_target_star~. ~p~Oh, just the thought of the rich, aromatic interplay of taste that just a sprinkle of ~mission_item~ adds to any meal has sent me into a miasma of longing that will not cease until it touches my tasting maw!!! ~p~Please, go! Be quick! In return, we will give you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks!
0x0000002D The nearest source of ~mission_item~ is at planet ~mission_source_planet~. Please pick some up and return as soon as possible. The unenlightened natives of ~mission_target_planet~ may give you trouble, but try not to harm them... even such as they have their place in the galactic order.
0x0000002E ~mission_item~ may be found at planet ~mission_target_planet~. The natives of ~mission_target_planet~ are infidels who have rejected the Way of Spode, and you may kill them or not as you see fit. 
0x0000002F Please travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting the ~mission_target_star~ system, and obtain a sample of ~mission_item~. Return to us as soon as possible. While this world is inhabited by a species that has rejected membership in our federation, you should not concern yourselves with them. Please return with as little loss of life as possible.
0x00000030 ~mission_item~ is found at planet ~mission_target_planet~, which is inhabited by a species immune to reason or economic incentive. Please employ as little violence as possible while procuring a supply of ~mission_item~, then return here. 
0x00000031 We've found that putting ~mission_item~ in the water supply increases health and well-being. Or at least the illusion of health and well-being, and since that's all that matters. We're running short... Can you bring us some?
0x00000032 The latest fashion is for ~mission_item~ to be formed into flower vases worn on the head, but demand is exceeding the supply. Could you bring us some, so that more of us can dress a la mode?
0x00000033 The nearest source of ~mission_item~ is at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Please pick some up and return as soon as possible. The natives of ~mission_target_planet~ may object, but their resistance will be paltry at best.
0x00000034 A supply of ~mission_item~ is at planet ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~ system. The people who live there are less spiritually advanced that we are, so feel free to ignore them. ~p~Don't fight them, however, it would mess up the karma. 
0x00000035 ~mission_item~ is found at planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~This world is inhabited by a native species. Our needs are more significant than theirs, so disregard them unless you want a little target practice.
0x0000011D ~mission_item~ is found at planet ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~ system. Go there, acquire a supply, and return. ~p~The native species may be killed or not, as suits your inclinations. 
0x0000011E ~mission_item~ is found at planet ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~ system. Go there, fill your holds, and return. ~p~There is intelligent life on the planet, but our need is greater than theirs. Don't employ unnecessary violence.
0x00000036 Yeah. I'll help out.
0x00000037 OK, I'll do it.
0x00000038 I think I can help.
0x00000039 OK, I'm off
0x0000003A No thanks.
0x0000003B I'm not interested. Thanks.
0x0000003C I don't think this mission is right for me.
0x0000003D I beg you. I cannot do what you ask.
0x0000003E This is fantastic news! ~p~If our scientists' calculations are correct, then industry and society should greatly benefit from our careful analysis of the ~mission_item~. ~p~You'll probably be hailed as a hero. Again. *Yawn*. ~p~Anyhow, we offer you a payment of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. Thanks for all your hard work.
0x0000003F You made short work of that mission, buddy! We can't thank you enough. Honestly. ~p~This ~mission_item~ is sure going to come in handy! ~p~For your efforts, please accept ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. ~p~You've been a super-duper help, buddy. Thanks! Really mean it!
0x00000040 This is such an exciting time for us, and it's all thanks to you! ~p~We offer you a payment of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~Soon, science and the ~mission_item~ will turn us into muscle-bound freaks no one will dare bully!!! ~p~Some say the ~mission_item~ causes unpredictable rages, and the... uhhh... shrinking of... bits... ~p~But it'll all be worth it the next time some bully comes looking to push us around for thrills!
0x00000041  ~player_creature_name~. Muwahahahahahaha!!! ~p~Now, we'll be able to unlock the mysteries of the ~mission_item~ and turn ourselves into an unstoppable army of hypertrophied super-beings! ~p~We will smash our enemies. See them flee before us, and hear the lamentations of their survivors!~p~Take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks and be gone!
0x00000042 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Oh, this ~mission_item~ will make for years of sumptuous dining fit for the Empress herself! ~p~There is the small matter of your recompense. I believe ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks was the offer, yes? ~p~Mmmmm. I wonder what dish I shall prepare first using this spice? Fried Horgblatts? Sugar-dipped Foonswaddles? Roast shoulder of Blomba-blags, in a reduction of Oogie-sauce? ~p~Oh, I think yes! Yes to all!
0x00000044 Thanks to your efforts, star system ~mission_source_empire_home_star~ remains an example to all the galaxy of an successfully managed world. We're happy to grant you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000045 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Thanks to you, the proper offerings may now be made to Spode. Let the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks be thine... and also the Holy Word of Spode, available in this portable edition.
0x00000046 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. The Grand Council is pleased with your contribution to our economy. I am authorized to offer you a Certificate of Commendation, Second Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000047 We thank you for providing a necessary boost to our economy. We hope these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks will help your own economic well-being.
0x00000048 Excellent. Our revels burn all the brighter thanks to you! Feel free to claim your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000049 Thanks to your magnificent act, our economy is now flourishing. After you pocket your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, please take a tour of our emporium.
0x0000004A Excellent! Enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks in the knowledge that you've helped us to become more transcendently special!
0x0000004B Thank you for this timely supply. We offer you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks in case the honor of serving us isn't enough for you.
0x0000011F  ~player_creature_name~. You have returned with ~mission_item~ of sufficient quality. As is customary among your species, we offer ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000120 Good work, Captain! The ~mission_item~ will be a great benefit to our economy. It's only fair that we give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000004C Let me ask you one more thing...
0x0000004D May I ask you something else?
0x0000004E I have one other question...
0x0000004F One more thing before I go...
0x00000050 Happy to help. Thanks again!
0x00000051 It's always a pleasure.
0x00000052 Nice doing business with you.
0x00000053 Enjoy. Service is my calling.
0x00000054 Let's review: ~p~We need you to go to the ~mission_target_star~ system and find the ~mission_item~ on planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~Once located, you must obtain the ~mission_item~, through any measures you deem appropriate. ~p~Be careful, be quick, be clean, and be thorough. And try not to forget what it is you're doing this time, okay?
0x00000055 What's the matter? Events got you spun around? Plagued by doubt and confusion? ~p~Are you looking for answers? We can help... ~p~Your destination awaits you in the ~mission_target_star~ system, on planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~There, you will find what you seek - the ~mission_item~. ~p~Get it however you can, and bring it to us.
0x00000056 Why are you back? We don't want to be pushy or a bother, but we really need that ~mission_item~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ star system. ~p~It's going to make us big and strong, and all the other Empires will stop their incessant bullying, when they see our giant muscles, with veins like road-maps! ~p~We'll show them!
0x00000057 Hey, we're not paying you to dawdle. Let's hop to it! Show some initiative! Here's a recap for ya, just in case: ~p~Ya gotta get to planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and find us the ~mission_item~. ~p~It apparently makes ya hugely powerful. We gotta get some for ourselves. ~p~Do whatever it takes. 
0x00000058 Do you have the ~mission_item~ spice? No? Do you need a recap: ~p~Bring unto us the aforementioned ~mission_item~, whose whereabouts are believed to be in the ~mission_target_star~ star system, on planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~You must hurry! I grow famished! ~p~The thought of ingesting food without the rich overtones of this spice positively turns my stomach now. Bring me some!
0x0000005A Our energy world is running out of ~mission_item~. Your own Mission Log states that you agreed to help us. Why haven't you brought the amount you promised?
0x0000005B You have not brought us ~mission_item~ as you promised, and as verified by your Mission Log. Spode's proper worship is in danger. Will you keep your word?
0x0000005C Our markets languish due to an insufficient supply of ~mission_item~. Its specifications are available in your Mission Log. Will you please acquire this item for us?
0x0000005D ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. According to the records in your own Mission Log, you had engaged to supply us with ~mission_item~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~. Do you intend to fulfill your agreement?
0x0000005E The demand for ~mission_item~ goes up and up, and you haven't brought us any! Check your Mission Log for the details! There's not much time left!
0x0000005F Our markets languish due to an insufficient supply of ~mission_item~. Why have you not brought it to us? The amount and source are specified in your Mission Log. 
0x00000060 Didn't you agree to bring us ~mission_item~? The demand is quite severe! Check your Mission Log for the details!
0x00000061 Your own Mission Log records your agreement to bring us ~mission_item~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~. Did those pathetic natives drive you away, or is there some other reason for your lack of success?
0x00000121 Despite the data uploaded to your Mission Log, you have not returned with a supply of ~mission_item~.
0x00000122 Despite the data uploaded to your Mission Log, you have not returned with a supply of ~mission_item~. Our need is great... can't you help us?
0x00000062 Let me ask you one more thing...
0x00000063 May I ask you something else?
0x00000064 I have one other question...
0x00000065 One more thing before I go...
0x00000066 I've had enough. I'm done.
0x00000067 I'm done. Find your own spices!
0x00000068 I quit! Get it yourself!
0x00000069 I cannot do this task. Please forgive me.
0x0000006A Right. I see. Okay.
0x0000006B Oh, yeah. That's right.
0x0000006C Cool. I've got it now.
0x0000006D Okay. I'm clear now.
0x0000006E It seems even this simple task is beyond you. We'll manage the task ourselves. 
0x0000006F ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Demonic forces must have stood in your way. We will praise Spode, and carry on.
0x00000070 Your unfortunate attempt has stimulated our compassion. Perhaps next time we will offer a simpler mission.
0x00000071 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Some species might view your ineptitude as charming, but in our economy there is no market in charm. 
0x00000072 You didn't bring the ~mission_item~? Our festivals will lose their luster!
0x00000073 Gracious! We thought you were, well, powerful or something. We will try to console ourselves by selling you items from our bazaar. 
0x00000074 But how will I reach the next trans-physical plane without ~mission_item~? 
0x00000075 Pathetic... doesn't begin to describe you, does it? 
0x00000123  ~player_creature_name~. Your species seems to be characterized by disorganized thought. 
0x00000124 You couldn't bring us our ~mission_item~? We were counting on you!
0x00000076 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000077 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000078 Can I ask about something else?
0x00000079 One more thing...
0x0000008B I need to move on. Farewell.
0x0000008C I beg your understanding.
0x0000007B We thought you wouldn't be able to resist the lure of such a potentially important discovery. ~p~Once on planet ~mission_target_planet~ you must return within ~mission_time~ sectons to further our goals.
0x0000007C That is super-fantastic news, buddy! ~p~We know you'll take care of things, handily! ~p~Once on planet ~mission_target_planet~ you must return within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x0000007E Once we possess the ~mission_item~, we'll be able to bully and torment so much more effectively! Once on planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have ~mission_time~ sectons to return.
0x0000007F Oh, how delightful! How wonderful that you'll do this for us! ~p~I'll restrain myself from discussing the meals we intend to make once you get us that ~mission_item~. It's best that you be on your way... ~p~Oh, one more couldn't hurt: Mmmm! Delicious, savory bruised and wilted Gaggyweed with a light glaze of cream of Sea Moocumber!~p~Once on planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have ~mission_time~ sectons to return with your culinary reward.
0x00000081 We will happily await your return. Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~. Once there, you have ~mission_time~ sectons to uphold your agreement and return.
0x00000082  ~mission_item~ is vital to Spode's worship! Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ where you'll have ~mission_time~ sectons to earn Spode's blessing.
0x00000083 The Grand Council is indebted to you. Please travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~ at once; upon arrival, you have ~mission_time~ sectons to complete your task.
0x00000084 A sufficient supply of ~mission_item~ is vital to our economic well-being! Make haste to planet ~mission_target_planet~ where you have only ~mission_time~ sectons so as not to jeopardize our plans. If there is trouble, please don't mention our names.
0x00000085 ~mission_item~ makes out little world go 'round! Once on planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have ~mission_time~ sectons to return and keep us spinning.
0x00000086 We salivate with anticipation. Please leave for planet ~mission_target_planet~ at once, where you'll have ~mission_time~ sectons to complete your task.
0x00000087 Your boldness strikes awe into our entire species. We tremble before your awesome majesty! ~p~Allow us to continue our worship by returning  within ~mission_time~ sectons. The clock starts when you arrive on planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000088 How pathetic ~mission_source_empire~ is before your mighty species! Should you return with sufficient ~mission_item~, we will tremble before your titanic magnificence! ~p~Once on planet ~mission_target_planet~ we expect you within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x00000089 You're wonderful to help us on our metaphysical mission this way! Despite time being beneath us, we need you to return within ~mission_time~ sectons. The galactic clock starts ticking upon your arrival on planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x0000008A Thank you. We appreciate a little piracy in a good cause. ~p~Your allotted ~mission_time~ sectons to complete the task begins once you arrive on planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000125 Leave immediately for planet ~mission_target_planet~. Upon arrival, you must return with ~mission_item~ within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x00000126 We'll look forward to acquiring ~mission_item~. Leave at once. ~p~When you arrive on planet ~mission_target_planet~ your have only ~mission_time~ sectons to fulfill your mission.
0x0000008D I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000008E Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000B3 Also...
0x000000B4 One more thing...
0x000000B5 I should be off. Farewell!
0x000000B6 Thank you for the opportunity. So long.
0x000000B8 I will return shortly. So long.
0x0000007A The task is at hand. Farewell.
0x0000008F That's most unfortunate. ~p~I'm sure we'll be able to find someone willing to aid us recover the ~mission_item~, but the staff psychologist said you were far and away the best candidate for job. ~p~Nobody does it better than you! 
0x00000090 Oh, buddy. You don't know what an exciting opportunity you're passing on. ~p~The journey to obtain the ~mission_item~ is sure to be filled with all sorts of excitement and adventure! ~p~I thought you had some backbone to go with those stormy good looks, but maybe I was wrong. Are you an invertebrate species?
0x00000091 Oh, uh. Okay. I mean, if you don't want to help... that's cool. Yeah... ~p~It's just... well... you see... uhh ~p~Well, we get picked on an awful lot. You seemed like a caring sort... ~p~Never mind. I'm sure we'll be okay. We always manage to survive. Somehow. ~p~Thanks anyway. Yeah.
0x00000092 Oh, this is most unwelcome! ~p~Even the most elegantly prepared gastronomic delicacies seem as flavorless and bland as Numbtongue Root, now that we know of the existence of this cache of the ~mission_item~. ~p~It's a shame you wouldn't help us. We were even considering letting you have a slice of Gangleberry Pie seasoned with the ~mission_item~ when you returned, and we're not known to share food with outsiders.
0x00000093 Oh, yeah? Ya think ya can just walk away from us, after we so generously provided you with mission specifics? ~p~Well, do you, pal? ~p~Do ya? Huh!?! DO YA!?! ~p~Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! We're just shinin' you on, pal!!! Just having a little fun with ya is all. We likes ya well enough not to blast ya to pieces. ~p~You don't wanna do the job, that's your problem and your loss. We'll just find someone else.
0x00000095 We'll manage our own resources, then. Goodbye. 
0x00000096 The intricacies of proper worship are clearly beyond the ~player_creature_name~. Farewell.
0x00000097 If you have business elsewhere, we will not detain you. Farewell.
0x00000098 If you will not help us, then logic suggests we must help ourselves. Goodbye. 
0x00000099 All right! If you're not into swashbuckling entrepreneurship and profits, we won't try to change your mind.
0x0000009A In that case, you must already have all the money you need. That being the case, please pay a visit to our bazaar.
0x0000009B We won't insist! We'll just keep our metaphysical wonderfulness to ourselves.
0x0000009C All right, we'll steal the stuff ourselves, then. 
0x00000127 Did you not understand our command? 
0x00000128 You don't want to steal someone else's resources? We're losing money! This is no time for an attack of morality!
0x0000009D Let me ask you one more thing...
0x0000009E May I ask you something else?
0x0000009F I have one other question...
0x000000A0 One more thing before I go...
0x000000A1 Ha! Well. Gotta go.
0x000000A2 Well, that is too bad now.
0x000000A3 Sorry I couldn't help.
0x000000A4 I beg your understanding.
0x000000A5 You realize, of course, that this is a terrible blemish on your record. ~p~What an unfortunate end to such a distinguished career. Pity. ~p~Oh, who am I kidding! There's always a place for you here. ~p~~player_creature_name~, we can't quit you!
0x000000A6 Buddy. Why do you gotta be such a drag!?! Such a downer? ~p~We offered you excitement! We offered you adventure! Why would you turn up your smeller at that? ~p~You look like the devil-may-care sort, full of verve and derring-do. I guess looks can be deceiving, buddy, because you're a real fuddy-duddy.
0x000000A7 Awwwww, c'mon! ~p~It's just not fair! If we were to try and get the ~mission_item~ ourselves, we'd get beaten like a pinata by all the galaxy's bullies out there. ~p~But in order to end our torment, we need the ~mission_item~! We need the aid of someone like you; someone who can handle themselves out there, in the cold, dark void. ~p~You know what you are? You're a big meanie!
0x000000A8 WHAT!!!???!!! ~p~How dare you disregard our assignment! You agreed! ~p~Now we gotta get all our ships outta dry-dock, and organize a party, and do this ourselves. What a pain! ~p~You coulda made this easy, but nooooooo! ~p~When we find the ~mission_item~ and turn ourselves into solid walls of well-trained muscle, well that's when we're gonna come looking for ya, bub? ~p~We'll be seeing you. Yeah...
0x000000A9 Oh, all our culinary plans are evaporating like so much stardust! ~p~We hired you to help us take our gastronomic creations to stratospheric heights of greatness, but in reality, you were whipping up an altogether more sinister dish - a souffle built on our raised expectations, a flambe ignited by our own inflamed desires. ~p~And now is time to sup on the fruits of your failure - our despair! ~p~Does it taste good?
0x000000AA MISSION STATUS: Aborted by Contractor. ~p~ASSESSMENT: Unacceptable! ~p~STERN LECTURE: In our day, when a body wanted some ~mission_item~, they had to invent interstellar travel and find it the hard way! Looking one planet at a time! ~p~SUMMATION: You young flitabouts don't know how good you've got it.
0x000000AB You set a new standard in unreliability. Goodbye.
0x000000AC Treachery is not rewarded by Spode. Goodbye.
0x000000AD It seems that you are not interested in a mutually beneficial relationship. We shall build our economy without you. Goodbye.
0x000000AE You won't do the job? Perhaps you will allow our scientists to surgically alter your brains to a more rational configuration.
0x000000AF Strange are the ways of the ~player_species~.
0x000000B0 We'll make all the money for ourselves then. Goodbye.
0x000000B1 First you will, then you won't. Then you will, then you won't. Why don't we just skip straight to the won't? 
0x000000B2 Your lack of honor is matched only by our lack of patience.
0x00000129 You beg for death? Perhaps we will grant this to you. 
0x0000012A This is no time to falter! Well, maybe it is.
0x000000B9 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000BA Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000BB Also...
0x000000BC One more thing...
0x000000BD Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000BE Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000BF I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000C0 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x000000C1 I beg your understanding. 
0x000000B7 ...
0x000000C2 Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x000000CD I need to review my mission.
0x000000CE The details of my mission have escaped me.
0x000000CF I'd like to review the details of my mission.
0x000000D2 Restate your request. My notes are unclear.
0x000000D3 Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x000000D4 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000D5 Also...
0x000000D6 One more thing...
0x0000007D I'd rather do something else.
0x000000D7 I need to decline this task.
0x000000D8 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000080 I beg to be released from this task.
0x000000D9 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000DA Until we speak again. So long.
0x00000094 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000DB I beg your understanding.
