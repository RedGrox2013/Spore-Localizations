0x00000001 It's starting to get a little cramped down here on the surface.~p~Our success as a species is bringing surprising and unexpected challenges to our own survival. Who woulda thunk it?~p~So, we need you to help us do a little expanding. We'd like you to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~Bring planet ~mission_target_planet~ to a Terraform Level of ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~It's worth ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks to us, since it's so important.
0x00000002 Buddy, we got a great project going. Check it:~p~We're growing Designer Consumers for our parent corporation, ObsequiCorp.~p~We need you to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~If you can bring the planetary Terraform Level to ~mission_terraform_target_score~, we can deposit our Consumer Species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ and start generating profits for ObsequiCorp.~p~And buddy, it's worth ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x00000003 We get picked on and bullied on a planetary scale an awful lot. We're growing worried about the long-term survival of our species.~p~We need you to bring planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system, to a suitable Terraform level for our habitation - ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~After all, the more planets we spread to, the less likely we are to go extinct from a single PBE - Planetary Bullying Event.
0x00000004 The richest and most powerful among us have decided that we've had enough of a bunch of poor and powerless ne'er-do-wells tryin' ta leech offa us like a buncha parasites, so we're getting outta here! Let's see how they like that!~p~Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~. It's in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Bring the terraform score to level ~mission_terraform_target_score~ in preparation for our relocation.~p~We'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x00000005 Did you know our Empress has the most extensive collection of show-worthy miniature Oogies in this entire arm of the Galaxy? It is true! Are you not impressed?~p~They've outgrown their current kennel-moon, so we'd like you to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~The Empress' Oogies are very particular, so please make sure you bring the terraform score to level ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~These Oogies are a treasure of our Empire, so we'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000006 MISSION ASSIGN: Terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ until it reaches the designated Terraform Target Score.~p~TERRAFORM TARGET SCORE: ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~STELLAR SYSTEM: ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~REASONING/OTHER: It knows what it did!~p~PAYMENT: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~QUERY: Does this assignment hold any interest for you?
0x00000007 As part of our mission to understand the interdependence of all living things, we would like a demonstration of your terraforming capabilities. Would you travel to ~mission_target_star~ and show us your knowledge of eco-metrics?
0x00000008 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been judged a suitable candidate for terraforming. Our own terraforming units are engaged elsewhere, but we thought you might be able to accomplish this mission for us. Would you help us expand the galactic life web?
0x00000009 Our mission is to spread life throughout the galaxy. You can help us by terraforming planet ~mission_target_planet~. Would you be interested in this task?
0x0000000A It is our task, given to us by Spode himself, that the barren places of the universe be made fruitful. A barren world has been found at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you be interested in populating it with Spode's glorious creations?
0x0000000B Holy pilgrims stand ready to populate a new world! This planet must be made ready for our species, however... would you render it suitable for Spode's People?
0x0000000C Spode commands us to bring the Light of Spode into all dark places! Unfortunately we can't do this if we can't breathe... could you possibly terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ for us, so that we can use it as a springboard to bring Spode's Light through the galaxy?
0x0000000D The Grand Council has assigned a high priority to preparing planets for settlement by our federation. One such likely planet has recently been discovered around star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you be interested in aiding us by terraforming this world?
0x0000000E Our survey of planet ~mission_target_planet~ indicates that it is suitable for terraforming. The Grand Council wishes to settle the planet at once. Can you help us by terraforming planet ~mission_target_planet~?
0x0000000F Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been deemed suitable for terraforming by the Grand Council. Will you help us with our mission of settlement and civilization?
0x00000010 We are interested in discovering as much as possible about the universe, which of course includes our neighbors and their technology. A suitable world has been found at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you be interested in giving us a demonstration of your abilities? In return for your cooperation, we would offer you suitable rewards.
0x00000011 A world has been found that may be suitable for settlement once a proper ecology has been established. Our own terraforming crews are busy on other projects. Would you be interesting in terraforming a world for us?
0x00000012 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is suitable for terraforming. This is a massive undertaking, and we wonder if ~player_creature_name~ are up to it?
0x00000013 We'd like to create a new party planet! It needs balmy breezes, picturesque landscapes, a variety of greenery capable of being turned into delicious beverages, and some interesting animals. Would you like to build it for us? 
0x00000014 We've found a worn-out old planet that we'd like to do over! Would you like to demonstrate your decorating skills?
0x00000015 There's nothing wrong with the ~mission_target_star~ system, but it's a boring old collection of planets! We'd like to liven up the neighborhood with a tres chic restyle! Would you like to handle that for us?
0x00000016 All the galaxy stands in awe of your knowledge and power. Perhaps this miserable creature may tempt you to a display of your terraforming prowess at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you consent to a demonstration in return for magnificent rewards?
0x00000017 A new world beckons, ready to be filled with consumers! But some adjustments to the environment are needed before a settlement can be contemplated. Making such adjustments would be trivial to a being of your magnificence... perhaps you could be tempted with a reward?
0x00000018 Our philosopher Gundrab named the Three Desirables: a gullible customer, a full purse, and a new planet bulging with natural resources ready to be exploited! This exploitation would be made easier if the planet were terraformed first... perhaps, in exchange for a generous commission, you would be willing to perform this task for us?
0x00000019 We're very much interested in the soul of ~player_creature_name~, and there's nothing so revealing of soul than the works of its creation. We've found a barren planet in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and we'd like you to reveal your soul by terraforming it. Would you reveal your soul for us?
0x0000001A Our seers tell us that the world-spirit of the barren ~mission_target_planet~ system yearns for a population to understand and care for it. Perhaps you would like to render it suitable for our settlement?
0x0000001B Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is like a blank canvas waiting the first kiss of the brush! Would you like to be the painter?
0x0000001C If planet ~mission_target_planet~ were terraformed, it would make an excellent forward military base. Would you be willing to contract this work? 
0x0000001D We are interested in the concept of non-destructive terraforming. Would you provide us with a demonstration?
0x0000001E Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is suitable for terraforming. We would be interested in discovering whether this is within your capabilities.
0x000000AF Planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems an ideal settlement if only it had a proper biosphere. Can you give us one?
0x000000B0 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in need of terraforming. Can you hack it?
0x000000B1 We wish to make barren planets bloom. Can you help us?
0x000000B2 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ requires a biosphere. You will supply it.
0x000000B3 We desire to know your terraforming capability. Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is available for this demonstration.
0x000000B4 We desire to study the spread of organic life, so that we may prevent it when necessary. You will aid us.
0x0000001F Can I get a little more information?
0x00000020 I could use a little more detail on how to get there
0x00000021 May I have some directions?
0x00000022 What's the best way to get there?
0x00000027 Pray continue. I am listening intently. 
0x00000023 Ugh. Terraforming is a chore. No thanks.
0x00000024 I'm really looking more for an *easy* payday.
0x00000025 Too hard. No, thanks.
0x00000026 Ooh. That's really not my specialty.
0x000000AD Regretfully, I must decline.

0x0000002E Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Terraform this world until it reaches the Terraform Target Score ~mission_terraform_target_score~, and may Spode bless you.
0x0000002F Life on ~mission_source_planet~ was seeded from planet ~mission_target_planet~. Unfortunately the records of planet ~mission_target_planet~ were destroyed in the catastrophe, but it is believed to be located in the vicinity of the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~Please locate the world, bring a complete sample of its life web, and return to ~mission_source_planet~. 
0x00000030 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Terraform this world until it reaches the Terraform Target Score ~mission_terraform_target_score~, then return.
0x00000031 The unspeakably dull planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Terraform this world until it reaches the Terraform Target Score ~mission_terraform_target_score~, and then we'll have a big party to celebrate!
0x00000032 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in star system ~mission_target_star~. Terraform this world until it reaches the Terraform Target Score ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~~group:star_clue~.
0x00000033 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ can be found in star system ~mission_target_star~. Terraform this world until it reaches the Terraform Target Score ~mission_terraform_target_score~, and then let us know so that we can send our happy settlers to live in harmony with this new world.

0x00000035 Yeah, why not. I'll do it.
0x00000036 Eh. I ain't got nothin' better to do.
0x00000037 Sounds like it could be fun. I'm in.
0x00000038 Sure. I'll do it. You can count on me.
0x00000028 I will do what you request.
0x00000039 Every planet is perfect just the way it is!
0x0000003A Terraforming is unnatural!
0x0000003B Terraforming goes against nature!
0x0000003C Regretfully, I must decline.
0x0000003D That's the best news we've heard in a Grox's age!~p~We'll start sending out hearty pioneers to planet ~mission_target_planet~ immediately. Their journey will be difficult, and it will be followed only by the hardships of building up this strange new world.~p~Still, their bold sacrifice will make it easier for those of us down here.~p~Here's a token of our thanks - ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000003E Oh, this is super-duper news, buddy!~p~Our vats were just reaching capacity. We've got a full crop of consumers ready to deposit on planet ~mission_target_planet~!~p~We'll have 'em buying ObsequiCorp products (exclusively) in no time. There's no need ObsequiCorp can't meet.~p~Which reminds me - here's your ~mission_rewards~ Spucks, buddy. Great Job!
0x0000003F *Phew*~p~We're so glad you came when you did! You earned every bit of your ~mission_rewards~ Spucks, for sure! We had another PBE while you were away.~p~No casualties this time, fortunately, which is not to underscore the seriousness of the attack.~p~To wit: Ask me where my undergarments are. Go ahead. The answer will surprise you...
0x00000040 Heh heh heh heh, pal. Nice work. Here's your ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. You've done an immeasurable favor to a whole lot of powerful individuals.~p~The traders wanna inherit the world so much - let's see how they like it when we let 'em have it, minus all the good stuff!~p~Heh heh heh heh heh heh...
0x00000041 Such wondrous news to tell the Empress! I will be showered with her largesse!~p~Here - take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks. You're worth tenfold the price! Figuratively speaking, of course.~p~Oh, there's so much to do in preparation for the Mini-Oogies relocation to planet ~mission_target_planet~. I'm afraid I must bid you adieu.~p~Take care. May your skies always be fair!

0x000000CF Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been provided with a biosphere, as we demanded. We understand that biologic species will require ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000004B Let me ask you one more thing...
0x0000004C I have one more thing to ask...
0x0000004D Can I ask you something else?
0x0000004E Just one more thing before I go...
0x0000004F Well. I enjoyed that. See ya!
0x00000050 Terraforming is always satisfying work. Bye.
0x00000051 Yeah, yeah. I'll be seeing you.
0x00000052 Well, guess that about wraps things up...
0x00000053 We need you to ease our population pressures by terraforming planet ~mission_target_planet~. This will help you get there:~p~~group:star_clue~.
0x00000054 C'mon, buddy. Pick up the pace!~p~You still need to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~. Here's roughly how to find it:~p~~group:star_clue~.
0x00000055 Please, please, please, terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~. Here's what we think is the quickest route:~p~~group:star_clue~.
0x00000056 What're ya waiting for!?! Get to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and terraform it, already!~p~We're not so good with directions, but here's a shot:~p~~group:star_clue~.
0x00000057 You do the Empress and her mini-Oogies a grave disservice by dallying while in Her service!~p~Go to  planet ~mission_target_planet~ and terraform it in preparation of the arrival of the mini-Oogies. Here's the quickest route:~p~~group:star_clue~.
0x00000058 MISSION STATUS: Ongoing; Contractor requires assistance.~p~MISSION OVERVIEW: Terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~ADDITIONAL/OTHER: ~group:star_clue~.
0x00000059 You haven't completed your work at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Is your terraforming capability inadequate? Or have you accidentally erased the data from your Mission Log?
0x0000005A Spode's glorious creation has not yet been seen the light of the ~mission_target_star~ system? Will you keep your promise, as verified by your Mission Log, and terraform this world?
0x0000005B Your Terraform Target Score does not meet the mission parameters. Will you be continuing your mission at the ~mission_target_star~ system? The necessary information is contained in your Mission Log.
0x0000005C Despite the data in your Mission Log, you seem to have not completed the terraforming of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Your choices are binary. Will you aid us or not?
0x0000005D Didn't you agree to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ by, say, about now? Take it from us, we're not enamored of deadbeat contractors! Check your Mission Log for the details of our agreement. 
0x0000005E Alas, you have failed to demonstrate your terraforming mightiness! Will you be continuing your mission at star system ~mission_target_star~? Or have you accidentally erased the information from your Mission Log?
0x0000005F We thought you were off to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ ? Is there some kind of problem? Doesn't your Mission Log have all the details? 
0x00000060 Are you unable to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~? Is there some difficulty with your Mission Log?
0x000000D0 We're still awaiting the successful terraforming of planet ~mission_target_planet~. The specs can be found in your Mission Log! .
0x000000D1 You have not yet succeeded in your task on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Parameters are available in your Mission Log. You will resume your mission immediately.
0x00000061 One other thing, then I'm off...
0x00000062 Just one more thing...
0x00000063 I'd like to ask about something else.
0x00000064 Can I ask you a question?
0x00000065 You didn't say this would be hard! I'm done!
0x00000066 This is tough. I quit.
0x00000067 Bah! I quit!
0x00000068 Nope. I'm done. Sorry.
0x00000069 Okay. I see now. Thanks.
0x0000006A Aha! Got it. Bye.
0x0000006B I understand. I'll return shortly.
0x0000006C Ahhh. Okay. That makes sense. Bye.
0x00000071 Oh, the Empress shall rejoice at the news!~p~Did you know that her Kennel dates back to before the Oogies achieved sentience and split from the creatures who would later become the miniature Oogies our Empress prizes so highly. Isn't that fascinating?~p~Anyway. ~group:star_clue~.~p~Off, off with you, till we meet again.
0x00000073 ~group:star_clue~.~p~We look forward to excellent results. We're confident you will create a beautiful world! 
0x00000074 ~group:star_clue~.~p~Let Spode's holy work commence at once. May Spode light your way to  planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000075 We are pleased to work together on this mission of civilization. Please depart for planet ~mission_target_planet~ at once. ~group:star_clue~. 
0x00000077 Data indicates the following: ~group:star_clue~.~p~We'll be looking forward to this demonstration of your abilities.
0x00000079 ~group:star_clue~.~p~Get started right away! And whatever you do, don't forget about the water feature!
0x0000007A You will create for us a real estate bonanza! Head for planet ~mission_target_planet~ immediately! 
0x0000007B ~group:star_clue~.~p~Please take this invisible amulet to light you on your way! 
0x0000007C Very good. Efficiency counts.
0x000000D2 Great! ~p~~group:star_clue~.~p~We'll look forward to visiting the galaxy's new garden spot!
0x000000D3 ~group:star_clue~.~p~You may begin. 
0x00000029 Lemme just ask one more thing...
0x0000002A Can I ask you something else?
0x0000002B I have one more thing to discuss.
0x0000002C Also...
0x0000007D I'll be back in a flash.
0x0000007E One planet, made to order. Comin' up!
0x0000007F I'll get things in shape in no time!
0x00000080 You can count on me.
0x00000081 Wh-wh-what!?! How could you abandon you own species like this!?!~p~If only we'd acted earlier - maybe when the glaciers sublimated? No, that was still too late...~p~Maybe when the forests immolated. No no. Still too late.~p~Maybe when the ozone layer was defenestrated?~p~Oh, it's all too much to contemplate. There's no sense in playing the blame game now, anyways
0x00000082 Oh, buddy. Buddy? Buuuuddy!~p~You're not just hurting us, buddy. You're hurting ObsequiCorp, and the whole ObsequiCorp family - all our affiliates, subsidiaries, shells, shelters, and our network of motivated Contractors such as yourself.~p~We weren't asking you to just do a job. No. We were asking you to join a family. The ObsequiCorp family.
0x00000083 Oh, tarnation!~p~Oh, my. Please excuse my outburst. I can assure you none of my invective is directed at you. Please don't harm us!~p~You don't need to help us protect ourselves from eradication in the face of these Planetary Bullying Events, but please don't add to our misery by committing a PBE, yourself! Please! We beg you!
0x00000084 Grrrrr.~p~If ya ain't gonna accept paying work, then don't go around askin' for any. What's wrong with you?~p~Bah! We're rich and powerful! Don't go messin' about with us. We're not organisms you wanna trifle with, understand?
0x00000085 Oh, the Empress will grow livid and angry when she hears of this terrible slight upon her and her Mini-Oogies! We'll definitely be drawing straws and such to see who delivers unto her this most unfortunate news.~p~Not it!
0x00000086 MISSION STATUS: In Abeyance; Rejected by Contractor.~p~STATEMENT OF IMMENSE IRRITATION: May the mighty ultra-mega-fauna of Coprolite-2 relieve themselves of their hundred-day binge of Greezy Burgeritos directly onto you and your meager little excuse for a spacecraft!~p~REASONING/OTHER: You know what you did!
0x00000087 If you won't, you won't. Goodbye. 
0x00000088 It is not for mere infidels to add to Spode's creation. Goodbye.
0x00000089 Very well. Our own teams shall prepare the planet for settlement. Farewell.
0x0000008A It's brave of a species to admit so frankly that they're incapable. Goodbye.
0x0000008B Too bad. We had so hoped these complex tasks wouldn't be so far beyond your abilities.
0x0000008C We will have to rely on our own poor efforts. Perhaps you may be tempted by our bazaar?
0x0000008D Oh well, I suppose you can't help it if you're not at one with nature, as we are. 
0x0000008E We shall take this inability into account in requesting future favors. Goodbye.
0x000000D4 You won't? We don't understand! 
0x000000D5 A command by the Grox is not to be disobeyed. 
0x0000008F Lemme just ask one more thing...
0x00000090 Can I ask you something else?
0x00000091 I have one more thing to discuss.
0x00000092 Also...
0x00000093 This mission just isn't a good fit... Goodbye.
0x00000094 I'm just not feelin' it, y'know? So long.
0x00000095 Yeah, sorry. See ya around.
0x00000096 No hard feelings, I'm sure. Farewell.
0x0000006D I beg your understanding. 
0x00000097 It would have been one thing to refuse the assignment when offered, but now? It's tantamount to sabotage!~p~We've lost precious time waiting in hope that you would come through for us.~p~I see now we were as foolish when we hired you as we were when we ignored the disappearance of the Grand Candyfudge Mountain!
0x00000098 Oh, no. That's not how it works here at ObsequiCorp, buddy.~p~You don't quit the ObsequiCorp Family... Because you can't quit a family, silly!~p~But if you want to leave our little family - The ObsequiCorp Family - then you feel free to go right ahead.~p~You'll be back. You'll see. ObsequiCorp loves you.
0x00000099 Oh, you awful little -- !~p~Oh my! What have I said!?! What have I done!?!~p~Please forgive my indiscretion! Emotion got the best of me, but I've come to my senses now. I promise.~p~Just please, don't hurt us! We couldn't bear the thought of a Planetary Bullying Event at the hand of the very individual we commissioned to safeguard us against such atrocities.
0x0000009A Oh, ho! You think you can quit? Why you little smear...~p~You can't quit! No one just walks away from one of our assignments, and especially not this one!~p~We'd blast you and your miserable little toy of spacecraft right now, but our private military contractor, Darkliquid, is busy quashing a peasant uprising right now.~p~You got lucky this time, punk!
0x0000009B Oh, the Empress and her mini-Oogies will be most aggravated by your decision.~p~(Hey everyone! I call 'not it' on informing her of the unfortunate decision on the part of our latest contractor.)~p~The Empress has launched wars for less than this, you scoundrel!~p~And her mini-Oogies would surely rend your flesh with anger when they learn they must inhabit the cramped conditions of their kennel-moon.~p~Begone, foul agent!
0x0000009C MISSION STATUS: In Abeyance; Aborted by Contractor.~p~STATEMENT OF EXTREME FRUSTRATION: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! What are we gonna do!?!~p~REASONING/OTHER: We don't know what we're going to do, but you know what you did!
0x0000009D You're wasting our time. 
0x0000009E Spode knows your treachery, and Spode will not forgive!
0x0000009F You will not conclude this mission? The Grand Council will be so informed. Goodbye.
0x000000A0 Have you considered brain implants? They may keep your minds on track. 
0x000000A1 The task was beyond you? We're not surprised. 
0x000000A2 You're breaking our contract! You'll hear from our lawyers about this!
0x000000A3 Giving up, eh? Oh well, the universe has many paths.
0x000000A4 Sometimes, when faced with one's own incompetence, it's the wiser thing to just give up. 
0x000000D6 We don't want to criticize, but you seem awfully scatterbrained today.
0x000000D7 Is there a ritual you would like performed after your death? 
0x0000006E I'd like to ask one more thing...
0x0000006F Can I ask you something else?
0x00000070 I have one more thing to discuss.
0x00000072 Also...
0x000000A5 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000A6 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000A7 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000A8 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x00000076 I beg your understanding. 
0x000000AE ...
0x000000BC Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!
0x000000A9 I need to review my mission.
0x000000AA The details of my mission have escaped me.
0x000000AB I'd like to review the details of my mission.
0x000000AC Restate your request. My notes are unclear.
0x000000BD Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!
0x000000D8 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000D9 Also...
0x000000DA One more thing...
0x000000DB I'd rather do something else.
0x000000DC I need to decline this task.
0x000000DD This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x000000DE I beg to be released from this task.
0x000000DF Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000E0 Until we speak again. So long.
0x000000E1 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000E2 I beg your understanding.
