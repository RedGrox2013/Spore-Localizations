0x00000001 It looks like the galaxy is filled with rare objects waiting to be discovered. We wonder if these objects are worth anything to someone.~p~Could you try finding another empire out in the galaxy that might want to purchase your rare object? It could fetch a few Sporebucks.
0x00000007 How can I do it?
0x0000000B I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x0000000C Ooh. Sorry. I've got a thing.
0x0000000D I can't. I'm busy.
0x00000002 You'll need to fly to another empire's planet and open trade negotiations with them. If your relationship is good enough, they may wish to trade with you.~p~If you're successful at setting up your rare trading operation, we'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks for your troubles.
0x00000022 I can do this.
0x00000029 I want to hang onto this for now.
0x00000033 Great job! Looks like one empire's junk is another empire's treasure. Take these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks and spend them wisely.
0x00000034 You are most welcome. Before I go...
0x0000003A Thanks. So long.
0x00000004 You still haven't sold that piece of junk... I mean treasure? Use your SETI Tool to scan the stars and locate other Space-Faring empire. There should be someone out there who's interested.
0x0000004A Got it. One other thing...
0x0000004E I'm a bit busy at the moment. Maybe later.
0x00000053 I'm off!
0x00000003 Maybe trading rare objects isn't for you. We have lots of other missions for you.
0x00000005 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000006 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000008 Can I ask about something else?
0x00000009 One more thing...
0x0000000A Sorry.
0x0000000E Excellent. Take care not to lose it. Travel to another empire's inhabited planets, and see if you can spark their interest.
0x00000015 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000019 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x0000001A Can I ask about something else?
0x0000001B One more thing...
0x0000005F Bye
0x0000000F Not interested in getting rich from trading treasures in an intergalactic black market? We have plenty more tasks that need doing.
0x0000006B I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x00000071 Bye
0x00000010 Ah, too bad. Well, if you still have the rare object sitting in your cargo hull collecting dust, you can always place it in one of your colonies to pretty it up.
0x0000001C I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000007E Thanks. Bye.
0x00000084 ...
0x00000085 I'm supposed to go where to get the what, now?
0x0000001D I'd like to ask you about something else...
0x0000001E Bye
0x00000011 Sell a rare to friendly empire.
0x00000012 Success! Return to your Homeworld.
0x00000013 Open Trade Negotiations through your Communication System to sell items.
0x00000014 You have successfully traded a rare object with another Empire. Return to your Homeworld.
0x00000016 Find another empire willing to trade with you. You'll need to make sure your relationship is strong enough to get them interested. To trade with another empire, fly to one of their planets and open communications with them. From there, choose the Trade option to Buy and Sell.~p~Completing this mission will earn you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000017 You have successfully traded a rare object with another empire. Return to your Homeworld.~p~Completing this mission will earn you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
