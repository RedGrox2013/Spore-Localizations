# mission_complete -do action_mission_complete -> do continue

0xFADED00E Another assignment may be the right thing.

# mission_assign -> goto mission_accept

0xFADED01B Count me in, I love Adventures.
0xFADED01A Sounds like an interesting Adventure.  I'm in.
0xFADED019 I'm always up for an Adventure!

# mission_assign -> goto mission_reject

0xFADED018 I appreciate the offer, but have to decline.
0xFADED01C I must decline, but I can't tell you why.

# dynamic_response_to_source -> do exit
# abort -do action_mission_abort -> do exit

0xFADED01E I beg your understanding.

# abort -do action_mission_abort -> do exit
# mission_reject -do action_mission_reject -> do exit

0xFADED009 Perhaps another time. So long.
0xFADED00A I can see you need a moment. Farewell.

# mission_complete -do action_mission_complete -> do exit

0xFADED016 No trouble at all. Farewell.
0xFADED015 A pleasure to help. So long.
0xFADED011 Anytime. See you later.

# dynamic_response_to_source -> goto abort

0xFADED020 I need to decline this task.
0xFADED021 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0xFADED022 I'd rather do something else.
0xFADED029 I beg to be released from this task.

# mission_accept -do action_mission_accept -> do continue
# mission_reject -do action_mission_reject -> do continue
# abort -do action_mission_abort -> do continue

0xFADED004 Before I go, I have other questions.

# mission_accept -do action_mission_accept -> do exit
# mission_incomplete -> do exit

0xFADED005 Got it. See ya.
0xFADED00C Will do! Take it easy!

# mission_complete -do action_mission_complete -> do exit
# mission_accept -do action_mission_accept -> do exit

0xFADED035 Roger that Mission Control.

# mission_accept -do action_mission_accept -> do continue
# mission_reject -do action_mission_reject -> do continue
# mission_complete -do action_mission_complete -> do continue
# abort -do action_mission_abort -> do continue
# mission_incomplete -> do continue

0xFADED001 I'd like to ask you something else...

# dynamic_response_to_source -> do exit

0xFADED02A Until we speak again. So long.

# mission_accept -do action_mission_accept -> do continue
# mission_reject -do action_mission_reject -> do continue
# mission_complete -do action_mission_complete -> do continue
# abort -do action_mission_abort -> do continue
# mission_incomplete -> do continue
# dynamic_response_to_source -> do continue

0xFADED002 One more thing...

# dynamic_response_to_source -> do continue

0xFADED026 Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!

# mission_assign -> goto mission_more

0xFADED017 ?

# mission_assign2 -> goto mission_reject
# mission_assign3 -> goto mission_reject
# mission_incomplete -> goto mission_reject
# mission_assign -> goto mission_reject

0xFADED01D I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.

# dynamic_response_to_source -> goto mission_incomplete

0xFADED01F I need a little refresher on the mission...
0xFADED027 Uhh... What am I supposed to do again?
0xFADED024 I forgot what I doing. What's my mission?
0xFADED025 Can you remind me of my mission?
0xFADED028 I spaced on my mission. What is it again?

# mission_incomplete -> do exit

0xFADED010 I see. I'll be back soon.

# dynamic_response_to_source -> do exit
# abort -do action_mission_abort -> do exit
# mission_reject -do action_mission_reject -> do exit

0xFADED008 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0xFADED00B I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.

# mission_incomplete -> goto mission_reject
# mission_assign -> goto mission_reject

0xFADED013 I'm not going to do this, for several reasons.

# mission_incomplete -> goto mission_reject

0xFADED00F This just doesn't feel right. No.
0xFADED00D I don't work for 'The Man'! No deal!
0xFADED014 Never! Clearly, I abhor violence.
0xFADED012 No. The whole thing feels... unsporting.

# dynamic_response_to_source

0xFADED023 ...

# abort -do action_mission_abort -> do exit
# mission_reject -do action_mission_reject -> do exit
# mission_accept -do action_mission_accept -> do exit
# mission_incomplete -> do exit

0xFADED007 Understood. Bye

# mission_accept -do action_mission_accept -> do continue
# mission_reject -do action_mission_reject -> do continue
# abort -do action_mission_abort -> do continue
# mission_incomplete -> do continue
# dynamic_response_to_source -> do continue

0xFADED003 Also...

# mission_complete -do action_mission_complete -> do continue
# mission_incomplete -> do continue
# dynamic_response_to_source -> do continue

0xFADED006 Before I go, I have other questions...

# abort -do action_mission_abort
# mission_reject -do action_mission_reject

0xFADED02C Oooh... okay... Yes, that's alright. ~p~If your heart is not in it, we wouldn't want you interacting with another life form... ~p~
0xFADED02B Interesting choice ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Perhaps you have some information we do not, although that seems unlikely.
0xFADED032 You must follow your own path.~p~Be well my friend.
0xFADED031 You dare to go back on your word to the Grox! Insolent fool!
0xFADED030 The ~race~ questions your indecision. It is clear you lack a strong force guiding your direction. How unfortunate.
0xFADED033 FINE...be THAT way.  It won't hurt our feelings.~p~OK...it hurt a little.
0xFADED034 Understood, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We appreciate your decorum.~p~It will actually save us a bit of paperwork. The sub-contract approval process for interplanetary creature transport requires only three hundred and sixty-two separate forms signed and stamped in triplicate. ~p~Of course, this is well below the guidelines established in the Standard Operating Procedure... You should see the required forms for transporting fermented spices.
0xFADED02D Of course, of course. I knew it was hopeless to bring such a trivial matter to so glorious a one as yourself. Perhaps you could console me by spending money in the boutique?
0xFADED02F Quit is not something ~race~ understand. ~player_creature_name~ is not ~race~.
0xFADED02E Looks like you'll have to find out how to be a legendary Space Captain on your own...the hard way.~p~Good luck with that.
