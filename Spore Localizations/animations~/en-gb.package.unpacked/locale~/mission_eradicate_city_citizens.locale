0x00000050 The troublemakers are all wearing glowing makeup, so it won't be hard to find them.~p~They should all be sent to their next incarnation, but please don't harm any plants or buildings, and don't hurt any innocent people. They've been traumatized enough.
0x000000E2 You failed to suppress the insurrection in time. We shall excise the cancer ourselves.
0x00000079 Those who fail to follow the Way of Spode are doomed. Consider this as you leave our worlds.
0x00000076 One more thing...
0x00000097 Hey, you got a minute?
0x000000AF Oh, yeah. What was I thinking? No.
0x000000C3 You don't care for the killing? Your weakness is noted.
0x000000F8 You won't keep the innocent children of planet ~mission_target_planet~ from being massacred? We had such faith in you!
0x0000000A A rogue scientist named Garb is at work on planet ~mission_target_planet~! He has created a brain implant which erases a person's memory and fills it with a desire to obey only Grox. He is in danger of subverting the entire population! Will you help us?
0x0000012B Mission Accomplished! Return to planet ~mission_source_planet~ for your rewards.
0x00000008 A plague landed from space is replacing our citizens on planet ~mission_target_planet~ with alien duplicates grown in pods! These creatures are attacking our citizens! Will you help us erase this menace?
0x00000099 Well, that was a lot of fun!
0x0000004A Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.
0x000000E3 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000078 If the task is not to your taste, we can't compel you. Goodbye.
0x0000012C Mission Failed. Return to planet ~mission_source_planet~.
0x0000005C Our holy cause has triumphed. The Enemies of Spode are no more. Praise Spode, and view your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~We also have a troupe of missionaries standing by, should you wish to speak with them.
0x00000074 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000106 Too much 'friendly' fire, return to the star system ~mission_source_star~.
0x000000AE I was gonna do *that*!?! No!
0x000000C5 Can you remind me of my mission?
0x000000C2 You give up? It's not like they were shooting back or anything!
0x0000005E Our humble words are completely inadequate to describe our happiness and gratitude. Please view your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and with them our bazaar.
0x000000E4 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x000000C4 I forgot what I doing. What's my mission?
0x00000098 Let's never speak of this again.
0x00000075 Also...
0x0000009A Thanks. Nice doing business with you.
0x00000077 We'll deal with this outbreak ourselves. You should hope that it doesn't spread to your own civilization.
0x00000073 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000020 The citizens of a certain world have voted to join our federation. Unfortunately, a minority has chosen to respond with violence. Will you take upon yourself the task of rehabilitating these criminals so that the will of the majority may be upheld, and this new and promising species may join our peaceful federation?
0x000000FD Abandon this mission and you may abandon hope for your people.
0x00000036 If you don't have a Mind Erase tool, you might consider getting one. It will calm any citizen who becomes agitated.~p~For this unfortunate but critical task, we will pay handsome fee of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks!
0x00000054 I accept your mission.
0x00000018 I'm not comfortable with this mission.
0x000000EE Terrorists are attacking on planet ~mission_target_planet~! We need you to help restore order!
0x00000091 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x00000004 I need to move on. Farewell.
0x00000084 I beg your understanding.
0x00000102 You failed to save lives on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The bad guys have won.
0x000000EC I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000055 Nope. Not gonna happen.
0x00000083 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x0000003C Missionaries spreading the Word of Spode have launched an attack on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Would you enjoy some target practice?
0x00000085 I need a little refresher on the mission...
0x000000F5 Leave at once for the ~mission_target_star~ system. On arrival, you have ~mission_time~ sectons. Destroy all marked life-forms. Do not harm our future slaves or their homes.
0x00000101 You have failed in a simple mission on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Your lack of capability has been noted.
0x00000025 Healthy interstellar competition resulted in the collapse of several industries on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Dismissed workers are now rioting, threatening to overturn the social order! Can this unworthy one trouble your excellence for aid, in return for reward?
0x000000ED A demonstration of your military capabilities will be undertaken on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Prepare to leave at once.
0x00000053 I accept this task.
0x00000090 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x0000008C Also...
0x000000F3 Those who are to be killed have been marked with a glowing substance. Kill only these individuals.
0x00000100 You killed civilians and wrecked property on planet ~mission_target_planet~! You've got to get control of your weapons, Captain!
0x0000002E I'm sorry, but no. I'm very busy right now.
0x0000008D One more thing...
0x0000008F Perhaps another time. So long.
0x00000038 Those who carry the Word of Spode are being attacked by ungrateful natives on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you help us destroy these violent worshippers of the God That Will Come?
0x0000008E Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000F6 Hurry, before the situation deteriorates! On planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have just ~mission_time~ sectons to help us.
0x000000B3 Got it. Okay. I'll be right back.
0x000000FE You're giving up? But that will create chaos!
0x000000B4 That's right. Okay. I'm off.
0x000000F1 A species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ has chosen to defy the Grox. You will curtail this behavior.
0x0000008A I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000003A Dissatisfied customers are attacking our boutiques on planet ~mission_target_planet~! Our kindred are in danger! If we offer you rewards, will you help us?
0x00000089 I beg your understanding.
0x000000A6 Our memories aren't always the most accurate in the galaxy, but we could have sworn that you'd agreed to go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and save our people from... you know... the folks who want to kill them! If your memories are as bad as ours, you might want to consult your Mission Log.
0x00000037 One of our scientists has attempted to seize control of planet ~mission_target_planet~! He's spread a plague that is turning members of the community into a vicious army! Can you help us defeat this menace?
0x0000008B Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000026 Some of our people on planet ~mission_target_planet~ ate a locus fungus in search of enlightenment, and now they're a bunch of brain-dead zombies with an unquenchable lust for blood! We could use your expertise with lasers in this matter.
0x000000B2 Right. I see. Be back soon.
0x00000052 I am ready.
0x000000B5 Oh, yeah. Awesome!
0x000000A7 Our kindred are still in danger at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Your agreement to this mission is recorded in your Mission Log. Are you still willing to rescue them?
0x000000EB This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000104 This planet is located in the ~mission_target_star~ star system.
0x000000E6 One more thing...
0x0000007E Also...
0x00000051 Targets carry incendiaries and glow brightly. You see bright and shinny, you kill. Kill them all.
0x00000095 I have another question...
0x00000105 All targeted citizens have been eliminated. Return to star system ~mission_source_star~.
0x000000A8 What are you doing here? You'd promised to go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and save our people from attack! Look in your Mission Log, if you don't remember!
0x00000094 Can I ask you something else?
0x0000002D No, thanks. This mission unsettles me.
0x000000B1 I beg to be released from this task.
0x0000007F One more thing...
0x00000002 This mission requires a deft touch. We will deny any involvement, so the best thing to do is not get caught.~p~If you are seen eradicating sick individuals, it will trigger a panic. If an entire city becomes panicked, you can expect military retaliation from the city's defenses.
0x000000C0 You quit?~p~You need to go to the control panel and press the 'persistence' button!
0x0000007D If you won't attack those who can't shoot back, what will you do when you face an armed enemy?
0x00000017 You're sick. I'm not helping.
0x00000096 Let me ask you something else...
0x0000007B Our cousins will die, and their emporiums will be looted. Our sadness is profound. The bazaar is closed for inventory.
0x0000007A But we were so looking forward to watching the stylish way you blow up stuff!
0x00000041 Nope. I'm not going to do this.
0x0000004B Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.
0x0000000F Strange alien missionaries who worship something called Spode arrived on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Now the converts are trying to kill those of us who follow the God That Will Come. We're tolerant about everything but intolerance, so we think it's probably a good idea to send these troublemakers to their afterlife. Would you help us out?
0x000000A4 Our citizens on planet ~mission_target_planet~ are still in danger of attack by infected civilians.~p~Your Mission Log contains all necessary parameters.~p~Will you intervene on our behalf?
0x00000040 Which way to I go?
0x0000005A The plague of altered citizens has been defeated with your aid, and we may begin the task of re-stabilizing the ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~. We're pleased to offer you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x000000B0 I'm not doing that. It sounds mean.
0x000000E5 Can I ask about something else?
0x0000007C You won't help us? In that case we'll have to call on the Savvy Zxxon Monks!
0x000000FB Despite the mission parameters uploaded to your Mission Log, you have not killed those marked for extermination on planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~You will do so at once.
0x00000080 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x00000103 Mission Failed. Return to planet ~mission_source_planet~.
0x00000034 Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~Can you accomplish this task?
0x000000E9 I'd rather do something else.
0x00000057 No. I don't approve of this.
0x0000000E Rioters on another world are threatening to loot our peaceful trading mission. As we are a peaceful people, our own possible responses are limited. Many rewards will be offered to anyone who can save our endangered kindred. Does the possibility of reward tempt you?
0x000000A5 Those who follow the Way of Spode are still enduring persecution at planet ~mission_target_planet~. All necessary information is available in your Mission Log. Will you save them as you promised?
0x000000BB I spaced on my mission. What is it again?
0x0000004D The wicked are aflame with demonic energy. Destroy them all, but spare the Followers of Spode!~p~Act quickly, before the wicked can gain the upper hand!
0x00000035 The arrival of religious radicals preaching the 'Way of Spode' have caused civil unrest on one of our worlds. Though the Grand Council guarantees freedom of worship, they cannot tolerate disorder. Can you help us restore the rule of law on planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000082 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x0000003D Where is this civilization?
0x000000F2 Revolutionaries are rioting on planet ~mission_target_planet~! We need you to rescue their victims!
0x00000056 No. I simply can't fit this into my schedule.
0x00000081 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x00000058 In the name of the Grand Assembly, we thank you. Please try to maintain a plausible deniability as you go about your task. You have only ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to terminate non-civilians.
0x000000BE We understand... you simply can't help your irrational conduct no matter how hard you try.
0x00000093 Thank you for your prompt and effective action at planet ~mission_target_planet~. We have observed your tactics and find them satisfactory. Please take these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x000000BF The Followers of Spode do not abide those who do not keep their word. Let your name be placed among the infidels.~p~Goodbye.
0x0000003F Where are they located.
0x000000E7 Oh, this news is most unwelcome indeed! We so hoped we had found someone with the same hypertrophied olfactory organs and appreciation of managed, aromatic environments as ourselves. Such a pity.
0x000000FC There's still chaos on planet ~mission_target_planet~! Weren't you going to help them?~p~All the necessary information is in your Mission Log.
0x000000E8 ...
0x000000BD Did the enemy buy you off? Goodbye.
0x00000027 An enemy biological strike against planet ~mission_target_planet~ has infected a number of our citizens, and turned them dangerous. As you are another species and cannot be infected, we ask you to cope with this situation.
0x00000120 I'm sorry. Can we discuss something else...
0x00000043 I'm not doing this. I'm just not.
0x000000DF Sorry, but the fourth quarter's over! You didn't save us in time. No biscuit!
0x00000060 Thank you for undertaking this disagreeable but necessary task. The disruptive minority of planet ~mission_target_planet~ must be eliminated so that the law-abiding citizens may life in peace and prosperity. You have only ~mission_time~ sectons to complete your mission.
0x00000121 Eliminate the infected citizens on planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x000000AB I have another question...
0x0000002A What happens if there's a commotion?
0x00000118 I beg your understanding.
0x0000006A Thank you so much! Please go straight to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and deal with the situation quickly, before your allotted ~mission_time~ sectons runs out.
0x0000000B A biochemical experiment in social control, aimed at increasing rationality and cooperation among our species, has gone disastrously wrong on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The subjects of the experiment are actually attacking their fellow citizens! Can you help us retrieve the situation?
0x0000009F Uhh... What am I supposed to do again?
0x00000119 Eliminate these beings from among the populace for the good of all. They have taken a unique, cultish costume that glows brightly under all conditions. This should make them easy for you to distinguish.
0x0000011A Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.
0x0000011B With all due respect, I must decline.
0x000000DE The demonic energy of the enemy was too great for you. Purified Warriors of Spode shall succeed where you have failed.
0x0000010B This mission is over. You have too much 'friendly' fire. ~p~Return to the ~mission_source_planet~ in star system ~mission_source_star~ immediately.
0x00000067 Let the ~mission_target_star~ system be purified of evil! Go with Spode! You have ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to incinerate the altered citizens.
0x000000A9 Insurgents still live! Your mission on planet ~mission_target_planet~ is incomplete. Your Mission Log should have all necessary information. When will you kill them?
0x000000E0 You raised our hopes, only to crush them. Perhaps you will endeavor to mitigate our unhappiness by spending freely in the emporium?
0x00000047 Floo fla flee fly to planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ star system.~p~Look for the glow, but only the glow. You must let the other ones go!
0x000000E1 You failed to help us in time! We'll have to do the mopping up, ourselves.
0x000000A1 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x000000C9 Welcome welcome! Step right up!! May I take your order? ~p~Oh. It's YOU.~p~Look at me! Look at what I've been reduced to! I wear this to work now!~p~You really messed things up for me, pally. You messed 'em up real good.
0x00000044 Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~Can you accomplish this task?
0x000000D9 I'm sorry. Good-bye.
0x000000D2 What's with this blowing up everything in sight? You were just supposed to kill the glowy things!
0x00000068 Ah ha! What fun!~p~Even more exciting, you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons on planet ~mission_target_planet~ to complete the removal.~p~Oh, I wish I could go and play too! So long!
0x00000117 Mission time has expired.
0x00000049 Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ star system.
0x00000009 Illegal gene-hackers have spread a zombie plague on planet ~mission_target_planet~!~p~This epidemic causes people to attack others, thus spreading the infection.~p~Sadly, the zombies must be turned into healthy organic compost before the epidemic sweeps their whole world!~p~Will you help us in this mission?
0x00000007 The fundamentals of galactic civilization require that all species conform to laws chosen by a consensus of citizens. Regrettably, a minority on one of our federate worlds have chosen not to abide by this standard of conduct. Would you undertake a mission to restore peace on this world?
0x00000122 Yes, there were complications...
0x0000010C You failed to eradicate diseased citizens on time. Go back to planet ~mission_source_planet~ in star system ~mission_source_star~ to give them the bad news.
0x00000021 The altered citizens glow in the dark, so they should be easy to find. Save the world by destroying them... and please don't harm friendly citizens or structures.~p~This mission is time-critical, so begin at once, and work fast!
0x00000013 We're willing to help.
0x0000011D Again, I beg your understanding.
0x0000006E See you shortly.
0x000000DC We received word the situation was more dire than what you could handle, so we've implemented Plan B.~p~Thank you for you efforts. Better luck in the future.
0x000000A2 The threat of anarchy still rages about planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you complete your task of bringing peace to planet ~mission_target_planet~? The parameters of the mission have been placed in your Mission Log.
0x000000AC Let me ask you something else...
0x0000011E We understand your reluctance to employ violence. We shall send our own peacekeepers to planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x0000009D I couldn't help notice that there's still plenty of competition for that job opening on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Now, why don't you take off for the ~mission_target_star~ system, and get rid of those reeking miscreants!
0x00000022 The Cult Against Reason, a group of artists bent on restoring chaos to our civilization, have infected themselves with a virus that turns them into enraged, homicidal monsters! Can you help us defeat them?
0x000000CD Also...
0x00000109 All targeted citizens have been eliminated. Return to planet ~mission_source_planet~ in the star system ~mission_source_star~ for your reward.
0x00000028 And if there's a panic?
0x0000011F I'd like to ask you something else...
0x000000CE Your wild shooting has resulted in damage to our citizens and their property. We wanted you to restore order, not smash our world!
0x00000048 Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~This task is for you, yes?
0x000000D0 You failed to follow instructions.~p~Your lack of conscience, however, may prove useful in the future.. Your indiscriminate slaughter has wreaked havoc with our cities! You've made the situation worse, not better! Goodbye!
0x0000002B How do I calm them down?
0x00000015 Sounds cruel but necessary.
0x000000DA One more thing...
0x00000042 I prefer missions with less... murder.
0x0000006B Go at once to the ~mission_target_star~ system. Kill only legitimate targets. Do not attack structures, and on no account harm our citizens who are not in revolt. You have only ~mission_time~ sectons to prove yourself.
0x000000DB We appreciate your efforts on our behalf, even as we deplore the outcome. By way of compensation the Grand Council offers you a Certificate of Commendation, Third...uh... Fourth Class.
0x0000002C I regret that I must decline.
0x0000006D I'll return when this is done.
0x0000011C With all due respect, I must decline.
0x00000011 I think I can help you.
0x0000006C Okay. I'll be back.
0x00000014 Give us a full briefing.
0x00000019 Maybe another time.
0x00000061 Excellent! Journey to the ~mission_target_star~ system. There, you will have ~mission_time~ sectons to save the planet!
0x00000113 Mission failed, too much 'friendly' fire.
0x00000012 I can be of service.
0x00000123 This wasn't my best work...
0x0000010F I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x000000D6 I'm sorry. I'll leave quietly.
0x000000D3 Your reckless violence has caused untold damage among our kindred! Our wretchedness knows no bounds!
0x000000AD Hey, you got a minute?
0x000000FA You've saved lives on planet ~mission_target_planet~! Captain, you've truly earned your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x000000D8 My deepest apologies. Good-bye.
0x00000125 I beg your understanding.
0x00000065 Travel to the ~mission_target_star~ system and kill the enemies of Spode within ~mission_time~ sectons. Our cause brooks no delay! May Spode's blessing go with you!
0x00000063 Head for the ~mission_target_star~ system. You have ~mission_time~ sectons to destroy the altered citizens and save the rest!
0x00000045 Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~Can you accomplish this task?
0x00000110 ~mission_num_eradicated_creatures~ out of ~mission_num_creatures~ targeted citizens eliminated.
0x000000D7 My bad. Whoopsy-daisy.
0x00000029 What if everybody panics?
0x00000024 We know a secret! No, no we couldn't possibly tell.~p~Fine! You win. We know of a certain planet that has been infiltrated by an evil force that will soon destroy all of its citizens.~p~Isn't that funny!? No??
0x0000005F Citizens of the federation participate freely in all activities permitted by the decision of the majority. The anarchic elements of planet ~mission_target_planet~ have been declared non-citizens by the Grand Assembly. Travel to the ~mission_target_star~ star system; once there, you must purge all non-citizens from our civilization within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x0000010E Until we speak again. So long.
0x000000D5 Did you think we wouldn't notice that you were causing wanton destruction on our world? ~p~Or was this an inept attempt at a declaration of war?
0x00000023 Missionaries on planet ~mission_target_planet~ have been attacked by treacherous followers of the God That Will Come. Will you help save their lives?
0x00000115 Possibility for infection. Incinerating...
0x0000009B Just doing my job.
0x000000C7 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000062 Your help in quelling this plague is greatly appreciated! Now go quickly to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and save our citizenry within ~mission_time~ sectons.
0x00000108 Eliminate the infected citizens on planet ~mission_target_planet~, in star system ~mission_target_star~.
0x0000010D Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x00000066 Truly Spode has sent you to our aid! Go to the ~mission_target_star~ system at once, and burn the evil ones with Spode's Holy Fire! You have ~mission_time~ sectons for your task.
0x000000F4 Those causing trouble are carrying bright incendiaries and seem to glow. They will need to be removed. But don't hurt civilians or damage property.
0x000000AA Can I ask you something else?
0x00000046 Your target is planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~Will you accept this assignment?
0x00000126 I must go now.
0x00000124 Let's focus on the future...
0x00000112 Limit kills to targeted individuals only, please.
0x0000001F We do not see the need to tell you how to use a simple device like Mind Erase.
0x00000111 All targeted citizens have been eliminated.
0x0000001A We would stress to carry out your work as discretely as possible.~p~Alternatively, our information has shown panic can be subdued with the Mind Erase device. You might want to make sure your ship is equipped with one.~p~
0x0000001B We're not a proud race, but our cowardice is legendary. If you get caught, we're gonna act like we don't even know you, so it's important not to cause an alarm.~p~If you cause too much panic, you'll be attacked by the city.~p~And just so we're clear, we do *not* got your back.
0x0000001C It would be logical to carry out your work as discretely as possible.~p~Alternatively, our research has shown panic can be subdued with the Mind Erase device. If your vessel is not equipped with one, you should consider getting one.~p~
0x00000092 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We're going to perform the Thanksgiving Song for fifteen hours in your honor. Please take these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and enjoy the performance!
0x00000087 Suh-weeeeet! ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. I just got off the phone with corporate. The job is mine! I start next week!~p~I can't thank you enough, buddy. I never doubted you for a minute.~p~Hey, you know the Company is always looking for young, ethically flexible, go-getters such as yourself, and I'd get a finders fee...~p~Anyhow, here's ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, as promised.
0x00000072 Oh, no! I suppose eventually we'll find someone willing to lend an appendage to this just task, but... ~p~It's just... ~p~We've intercepted shipment manifests for large quantities of toilet paper and eggs. No good can come of that!
0x0000004E Breathe deep, brave Captain! Our noses have been freed! Can you not smell the many fragrant scents of my people? The fine cuisine! Our local flora! The constant gaseous emissions from our methane vacuoles! Delightful! Wonderful!~p~You've earned every bit of the ~mission_rewards~ Spucks we promised in compensation.
0x0000004F MISSION STATUS: Completed.~p~PAYMENT: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~NOTES: Awesome!
0x000000DD Perhaps the most unfortunate element of the situation on planet ~mission_target_planet~ was that we relied on ~player_creature_name~ to cope with it. Farewell.
0x00000088 I can't believe it's finally over. You're sure they're all gone?~p~Awesome!~p~Here is your ~mission_rewards~ Spucks, as promised.~p~You should stay. There's bound to be a planetwide celebration, and if you're as big a fan of balloon animals and low-sodium, low-fat, low-carb, sugar-free nutrition sticks as I am, then you'll just love it!
0x00000031 We get worked up into a tizzy (existential dread, you know) about once a month, and nothing soothes away worries like a little Mind Erase Ray to the temple. You should try that, assuming you have one.~p~Rid us of this menace, and we'll give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000001 A strange new alien microbe is aggressively targeting sentient species, and is currently spreading throughout the cities on the planet of ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~We wish there were another way, but it appears our only chance at containment is to purge the sick from the population altogether.~p~We need you to eliminate all afflicted citizens, without incurring unacceptable losses among the healthy populace.
0x0000001D It would be wise to carry out your work as discretely as possible.~p~Alternatively, our research has shown panic can be subdued with the Mind Erase device. We hope your ship has one equipped.~p~
0x000000D4 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You've perpetrated a massacre on planet ~mission_target_planet~! I'd try to get out of the way of the Karma Train if I were you!
0x000000EF It is necessary to cull intelligent life on planet ~mission_target_planet~. We have chosen ~player_creature_name~ for this mission.
0x00000006 Yes, yes... I suppose you are right. Perhaps the awry should be righted.~p~Fine! We charge you to ZAP the imposters but not the regular citizens. No, no. They must be left alone.~p~
0x0000002F Studies have shown that the best approach is to employ your Spacecraft's Mind Erase Ray, assuming you have one. It's simple, it's effective, and theoretically, it's hilarious.~p~Please, be thorough in all regards. We can't afford a mass panic, much less a pandemic!~p~Do this successfully, and we'll give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x000000EA I need to decline this task.
0x00000030 The Mind Erase Ray in my spacecraft always works like a charm. I use it all the time. On others.~p~It really gives me that edge that I need to get ahead, if you know what I mean.~p~This job comes with like a HUGE pay-raise, so you make this happen for me, and I'll hook you up with ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000033 A panicked citizenry is always a hot bother, but fret not. A solution lies at the ready! Simply placate the plebes with the liberal dose of your Mind Erase Ray. You do have one?~p~We have an old saying here: 'What you don't know and can't smell, won't hurt you'. Hoo hah. Hoo hah. Guffaw. How Delightfully ribald!~p~For your efforts, you shall be remunerated with ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000000C Treacherous worshippers of the God That Will Come are attacking Spode's people on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Our military is supporting missionary work elsewhere and cannot respond immediately. Can you help us crush these wicked and willful enemies of Spode?
0x000000F9 ~player_creature_name~. Your mission at planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been successful. In return, we offer ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x000000FF ~player_creature_name~. Your attack on planet ~mission_target_planet~ lacked discrimination. You were instructed to destroy only those marked for extermination. You failed to follow instructions.~p~. Your lack of conscience, however, may prove useful in the future.
0x000000B9 It ain't that easy, pal. Sure, you can quit, but you should know: your name's gettin' added to the bottom of...~p~THE LIST!!!~p~We'll be seeing you... lemme just check the schedule here... in about three billion years.~p~FEAR THE LIST! FEAR IT FOR EONS!
0x000000A0 The smell still hangs over everything for light years! It is an affront to the sense of civilized beings!~p~Please, we beseech you. Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~, in orbit around the star system ~mission_target_star~ and eradicate all the citizens with hygiene problems.~p~You shall know them by their stink clouds!
0x0000009E You forgot your mission? I'm sure it's somehow our fault. Please, forgive us.~p~Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ circling the star system ~mission_target_star~, and eliminate all the bullies in the cities. You'll be able to identify them by their clouds of... awfulness.
0x00000059 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We thank you in the name of the Grand Assembly. We are prepared to award you a Certificate of Commendation, Second Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~We also request that you not discuss this matter with anyone. Thank you.
0x00000039 It wasn't us... or was it? Well, we can't recall... But the point is this.~p~Pun-telling robots, disguised as locales, were deposited onto planet ~mission_target_planet~ all in the name of fun... but we forgot a bit of programming and now we need to remove these droids before they take over the planet!
0x00000003 We've been bullied up and down this galaxy for millennia by a secret cabal of thugs on planet ~mission_target_planet~. At grave peril to my people, we've obtained technology that can expose these monsters... ~p~We want you to find all the thugs, and turn them to ash!~p~We're usually not this vindictive, but have you ever endured an Event Horizon Swirlie? It's terrible!
0x000000A3 Altered citizens are still multiplying at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Aren't you going to help us suppress them? All the details are in your Mission Log.
0x000000BC I am informed that you have failed to prevent our federated world from falling into anarchy. We can but wonder if ~player_creature_name~ instigated the violence in the first place. Goodbye.
0x000000CA Oh no! How terrible! You've really stirred up a hornets nest this time!~p~We'll deny we ever took part! We'll deny everything!~p~In fact, who are you? We don't know you! We've never seen you before in our lives! We'll swear on it!
0x000000CC O, terrible fates! ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. The mission is an utter catastrophe! Now we not only do we still have this oppressive scent to deal with, but the planet ~mission_target_planet~ is outraged at our impropriety, as well!~p~We stand at the edge of ruin, the precipice of the void itself!
0x000000CB Not that we got a problem with it in principle, but when you kill too many innocents like that, we gotta pull the plug, 'cause it causes us monumental headaches down the line.~p~We hate headaches. You know what you just did? Do ya? Huh?~p~You just got your name added to...~p~THE LIST!!!
0x00000064 Go at once to the ~mission_target_star~ system. Kill those whose unbalanced chemistry causes them to glow with cold radiance. Do not harm innocent citizens or structures, and fulfill your duties before ~mission_time~ sectons elapses.
0x00000071 Awww, buddy. Don't be like that. What's with the cold shoulder? It's not like we're asking you to kill anybody.~p~Oh, wait. I guess we are. Huh. How 'bout that?~p~Okay. Well, just keep it to yourself. Corporate likes to see their employees take initiative, but they'd probably misunderstand something like this.
0x000000D1 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. The demonic energy of the enemy was too great for you. Purified Warriors of Spode shall succeed where you have failed.
0x000000B7 Are. You. Kidding. Me!?!~p~You can't just quit! That's not how you get ahead in the universe! How am I supposed to get that job at Corporate Headquarters now? Hard, honest work? I don't think so!~p~You know what? I won't tolerate this insubordination - you're fired!
0x0000000D We hate to admit it... but a silly little prank has gone awry.~p~To cause confusion, we created clones of the people of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and unleashed them into the cities.~p~Imagine! Walking down the street and seeing the same person over and over! What fun!
0x000000C1 You have failed to prevent tragedy among our species? Let your name be listed among those customers with delinquent accounts. Goodbye.
0x000000C8 Nice shootin' there, pawdner! Hey, thanks for making a touchy situation much, much worse.~p~You will not believe the paper work you left me with.~p~Just... just go.
0x0000004C ~player_creature_name~. Our dastardly plan is falling into place, one star system at a time. In a few billion years, all of the galaxy's gonna know you mess with us, you're just asking for trouble!~p~Here's the ~mission_rewards~ Spucks, as promised.~p~Even better, your name's not going on...~p~THE LIST!!!
0x000000B8 You quit!?! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!...~p~...~p~I'm sorry. I got a little panicky, and had to administer a small dose from the Mind Erase Ray to calm down.~p~Soooo... who are you again?
0x000000B6 ~player_creature_name~, ~player_creature_name~, ~player_creature_name~...~p~You've disappointed us all, and placed us in grave danger of expose to this virus.~p~The tabloids are going to go crazy over this!
0x000000F7 ~player_creature_name~ is not proving useful to the Grox. Take care that you are not marked for extermination as well.
0x0000005B ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You have relieved the situation at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Please take ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and endeavor to forget this unfortunate incident as soon as possible.
0x00000070 I thought you had the iron constitution necessary for a grim task such as this. I'm sorry to hear you're not up to it. I guess there's no stopping the disease now.~p~If you won't help directly, at least do your part and buy duct tape and miniature flags.
0x000000BA How cruel! How uncaring! To lift our hopes on sails spun of lies, and then dash them to pieces along the rocky shoals of our own desperation!~p~Something stinks here, indeed - YOU!
0x0000006F What? You refuse? Why, we oughta...~p~Curses! That about tears it! We don't like you! You know what that means? You just made...~p~THE LIST!!!~p~There you go, your name's been added to the bottom. You can expect to reap a terrible whirlwind in a few billion years or... maybe, tomorrow! Take that!
0x0000003B On planet ~mission_target_planet~, the Crazy Slaughter Cult is living up to its name! Can you give us a hand?
0x0000005D We are going to so totally celebrate your martial awesomeness now! Take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and fill your glass with a suitable beverage!
0x00000010 A renegade militarist group, preaching a War Against All has launched an insurrection on planet ~mission_target_planet~. We can suppress them easily, but these cultists will be far more humiliated if their insurrection is suppressed by another species. Would you aid us?
0x00000032 Ha! This part's the best!~p~To calm down uppity citizens, use your Mind Erase Ray. That always shuts 'em right up!~p~No memory, no foul! Am I right? Ha Ha! Hope you have one.~p~The pay's good - ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x00000005 Achh! The stench! You can smell it for parsecs! It befouls and bedevils our keen olfactory senses!~p~It's the ~mission_target_planet~ citizens, you know. Placing tact and decorum aside for the moment, some of them are literally stinking up the heavens!~p~We've petitioned them to alter their hygiene, but to no avail. Enough, we say! It's time these malodorous maladroits were given a thorough cleansing! With lasers!
0x0000003E Okay. Where do I go?
0x0000009C Okay. Here's a recap:~p~Go to the ~mission_target_star~ star system and then head to planet ~mission_target_planet~.~p~Destroy all the diseased citizens without killing too many healthy people in the process. Use your mind erase ray to cover your tracks, if you have one.~p~This conversation never happened.
0x000000F0 Missionaries preaching the 'Way of Spode' have started a violent revolution on planet ~mission_target_planet~! Can you help out?
0x00000069 A febrile tendril of hope gropes for the light! Please travel to the ~mission_target_star~ system at once and save our cousins! The rioters are arsonists who carry torches, so they should be easy to locate.~p~Be careful to kill only the wicked and not our kin. And do so quickly; on planet ~mission_target_planet~ you have only ~mission_time~ sectons !
0x00000086 This task was ugly. I always knew you were the right ~player_creature_name~ for the job.~p~Wait. That came out wrong. I'm not saying you're ugly. I'm just...~p~Look. Let's forget this whole exchange.~p~Here's ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks as promised.
0x00000116 Infected life form. Incinerating...
0x00000114 Kill ~mission_num_healthy_creatures_left~ more innocent ~^p^mission_num_healthy_creatures_left^citizen^citizens~, and you will cause an 'incident'.
0x0000001E Shoot not your target in front of the feeble minded, but if it cannot be avoided, they are equally swayed with a device of Mind Erase. Get one you should.
0x000000C6 Ah, of course! The Mission Log. I will look there!
0x00000107 You failed to eradicate diseased citizens on time. Go back to star system ~mission_source_star~ to give them the bad news.
0x000000CF Oh the morbidity! ~p~Perhaps you did your best but... such an unfortunate loss of innocent life! ~p~This calls for a moment of silence.
0x00000016 No way! I'm not helping you do that!
