0x000000DE the star name is ~mission_target_star~
0x0000007F Enough! I'm done.
0x000000B0 Also...
0x0000004D I beg for your forgiveness, I cannot do what you ask.
0x000000F4 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x0000007D One other thing...
0x0000009E Thank you for the opportunity. So long.
0x00000051 That coulda been quicker! You get lost in another universe or something? You got the ~mission_item~? Hey, it's slightly scuffed! Is that chipped paint? What's this stain? Well, I guess it's not *completely* ruined - here's ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x000000CC ...
0x0000009A Also...
0x00000002 ~group:plain_fictions~ We'd do it ourselves if our sciatica weren't acting up. Plus, interstellar travel always dries out our sinuses. Plus, the ~race~ suffer from corns and flat feet.
0x000000AF Is that all?
0x0000004E You have returned to your people victorious! This ~mission_item~ cements the ~race~ as players on the intergalactic stage! For your efforts, please accept ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x000000CE I'd like to review the details of my mission.
0x000000EF One more thing...
0x00000026 The ~mission_item~ fell into the hands of the accursed enemy in the heat of glorious battle. Our honor demands it be retrieved. You shall aid us!
0x00000091 Once you locate the planet you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons to retrieve the ~mission_item~.~p~We thank you, and will pray that you fulfill your destined mission.
0x00000099 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x000000A0 The task is at hand. Farewell.
0x00000006 We have a hot tip that a ~mission_item~ has been spotted seeming abandoned for the taking. Don't you think it would make a lovely addition to our ~race~ National Museum?
0x000000F7 Until we speak again. So long.
0x000000CB I beg your understanding.
0x00000077 I understand. Before I go...
0x0000007A Got it. One other thing...
0x00000087 Wilco! Out!
0x0000002F Our ~mission_item~ went missing eons ago. However, intel reports that it's been located on another planet.
0x000000F8 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x00000022 How do I get there?
0x0000009F I will return shortly. So long.
0x00000050 *Gasp*!!! The ~mission_item~ - you have it! Inconceivable! Even though my people suffer from hypoglycemia and hemophilia, we have been selling our blood and other fluids in order to pay you the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks we owe.
0x0000003D Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!
0x0000009C I should be off. Farewell!
0x00000078 Before I go...
0x00000024 Ooh. Sorry. I've got a thing.
0x000000F5 You failed to fetch ~mission_item~ on time. Go back to ~mission_source_star~ system to give them the bad news.
0x00000080 I beg to be released from this task.
0x00000079 One other thing...
0x00000081 Nevermind. I quit!
0x00000085 I'll be back!
0x00000088 I'm on it. Sit tight!
0x0000002B Spies and enemies of the ~race~ endeavor to undermine us. Now they have... acquiring an important relic from one of our lesser colonies, throwing it into turmoil. Recover the ~mission_item~ and peace shall be restored.
0x000000F0 Do not delay. Once you locate the planet you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons to retrieve the ~mission_item~. Be gone.
0x00000076 Got it. One other thing...
0x00000032 The ~mission_item~ has vanished! This priceless artifact is the keystone to our civilization. We shall be lost without it!
0x000000AD You must follow your own path.~p~Be well my friend.
0x000000D2 Return to planet ~mission_source_planet~.
0x000000CF Restate your request. My notes are unclear.
0x00000098 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000007C Before I go...
0x000000F1 I'd rather do something else.
0x0000004B No, sir. Not interested.
0x0000004C I regret that I must decline.
0x000000D6 You've retrieved ~mission_item~ successfully. Return to planet ~mission_source_planet~ in star system ~mission_source_star~.
0x0000009B One more thing...
0x000000CD I need to review my mission.
0x0000007B I understand. Before I go...
0x000000DA An important cultural symbol has gone missing. Our people cry out for the lost ~mission_item~.
0x00000027 The ~mission_item~ has been found. Sadly, it fell into the hands of backwater yokels. It bears great significance to our society. Retrieve it from these grinning hay-seeds.
0x000000E3 Mission Failed. Go back to planet ~mission_source_planet~.
0x000000D1 Find the treasured ~mission_item~.
0x000000B3 We will speak again. Farewell.
0x00000046 Okay, I'll do it. Does someone need a hug?
0x0000002A The ~mission_item~ fell into the hands of the accursed enemy in the heat of glorious battle. Our honor demands it be retrieved. You shall aid us!
0x0000001F How can I find it?
0x000000C7 I'd like to ask you something else...
0x0000008A Let's focus on the future...
0x00000005 The ~race~ require the ~mission_item~. Deliver at earliest convenience. End.
0x000000D4 You've retrieved ~mission_item~ successfully. Go back to ~mission_source_star~ for fame and glory.
0x000000A2 This is very bad news, bad news indeed.~p~You failed to obtain the ~mission_item~ in time.
0x000000D0 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000063 I'm sorry. Can we discuss something else...
0x00000045 I'll do it. You should rest.
0x00000062 I should be off. Farewell!
0x000000AB Go on...
0x000000C9 Also...
0x00000089 Thank you, Captain!~p~There is a matter of urgency. Once you locate the planet you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons to retrieve the ~mission_item~.~p~We await your return
0x000000E7 You will leave immediately on a search for a ~mission_item~.
0x00000068 We need the elusive ~mission_item~. We possess incomplete intel about its location, but we believe ~group:star_clue~.
0x000000AC Umm... I have another question...
0x00000052 O, noble and intrepid explorer - you have brought us the ~mission_item~! The people of planet ~planet_name~ have retired to their parlor-rooms, busily composing sonnets and song of your most heroic travails! Our payment of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks alone is not adequate tribute. Perhaps you will come to our open mic night next month?
0x00000069 We apologize for the unacceptably poor explanation we must have provided to you when you accepted the quest to find ~mission_item~. Someone will be flogged. Sadly, we only have fragments of the information we need: ~group:star_clue~.
0x00000047 I'll do it. Just stop talking.
0x00000053 May Spode have mercy on you for failing to acquire the ~mission_item~ in a timely manner.
0x00000025 I can't. I'm busy.
0x00000066 Yes, there were complications...
0x00000096 I need to move on. Farewell.
0x00000065 Good bye, see you again.
0x00000030 While the ~race~ already possess all manner of fantastic technologies, we recently learned of an extraordinary artifact, the ~mission_item~, while exploring a local star system.
0x00000086 I won't let you down! Bye!
0x00000067 This wasn't my best work...
0x00000033 For ages, my people have dreamt of seeing the ~mission_item~ for ourselves. We have learned it is nearby, and we seek a third party to retrieve it for us.
0x000000C8 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000060 There is one other thing...
0x00000021 Tell me where to go.
0x00000095 I beg your understanding.
0x000000BF You must follow your own path.~p~Be well my friend.
0x000000A4 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x00000028 The ~mission_item~ is essential to the peaceful relations between our respected interplanetary colleagues and ourselves. We must ensure its safe return to us.
0x000000D8 You've retrieved ~mission_item~ successfully.
0x000000A5 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x00000061 Thanks. One more thing...
0x00000020 Where should I look?
0x0000008C Be snappy about it! Once you locate the planet you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons to retrieve the ~mission_item~.
0x0000005E No trouble at all. Before I head out...
0x000000C4 Think twice before you waste our time.
0x0000005D Glad I could assist you. Before I go...
0x000000A8 Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!
0x00000082 I beg to be released from this task.
0x0000005F Also...
0x000000A6 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x00000043 I won't fail our people!
0x0000005C You are most welcome. Before I go...
0x000000C6 Defiance in a species such as yours brings not respect, but destruction.
0x000000AA The details of my mission have escaped me.
0x000000BA Defiance in a species such as yours brings not respect, but destruction.
0x00000083 I'm off!
0x000000D9 For many years we have sought to complete our collection of antiquities. But alas, the spot for the ~mission_item~ remains unfilled.
0x0000008D We shall light a candle for you!~p~Once you locate the planet you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons to retrieve the ~mission_item~.~p~Don't let your flame begin to sputter!
0x0000008B Excellent! The Grand Council thanks you for your efforts.~p~Once you locate the planet you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons to retrieve the ~mission_item~.~p~Good luck and happy exploring.
0x00000031 The long, lost ~mission_item~ was discovered recently. Our agents report that its retrieval will incur an unacceptably low level of violence. Therefore, we seek the aid of an outsider. Aid us.
0x000000E2 Also...
0x000000B2 Perhaps another time. So long.
0x00000003 Ha! We've crushed more advanced races than you beneath our boot-heels. Prove yourself to the mighty ~race~.~p~~group:angry_fictions~~p~Deliver this to us, and we shall allow your people to... exist.
0x00000090 Thank you! Once you locate the planet you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons to retrieve the ~mission_item~.~p~This may be crucial to our task of bringing organic life to the galaxy's barren places.
0x000000B7 No? Are you sure? The person who delivers unto us the fabled ~mission_item~ will be the exalted guest of honor at our next month-long, ritualized poetry festival! Surely, that will change your mind!
0x00000023 I'm not interested right now. Maybe later.
0x0000002D Tremendous news! We've discovered the location of the ~mission_item~! We must possess it. Our collection of antiquities is sorely lacking without it.
0x000000C3 No? Are you sure? The person who delivers unto us the fabled ~mission_item~ will be the exalted guest of honor at our next month-long, ritualized poetry festival! Surely, that will change your mind!
0x00000044 Yes. Your smarm - I mean, charm has won me over.
0x000000A3 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000CA One more thing...
0x00000004 Forsooth! You seek employment? Verily, this is truly an auspicious occasion.~p~~group:plain_fictions~~p~Will you accept this quest, this magnificent journey of the stars?
0x00000049 No thank you. Maybe another time.
0x00000001 You are both resplendent and magnanimous. ~group:plain_fictions~ Retrieve the item, and your name shall be sung through the ages. We are unworthy.
0x0000006C Our savior returns from his quest to find ~mission_item~ ! Double-checking, are we? Thoroughness is the product of a well-ordered mind, after all. The legend is little more than shadow and whisper, but we know that ~group:star_clue~.
0x00000097 I beg your understanding.
0x00000084 Up and away! This time for reals!
0x00000071 Did you find planet ~mission_target_planet~? All relevant data should be in your Mission Log.
0x000000B1 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x000000B4 I beg your understanding.
0x0000006F Did you locate planet ~mission_target_planet~? Where is the ~mission_item~? All information should be in your Mission Log.
0x00000092 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.
0x0000004A Actually, I've just realized how busy I am.
0x000000B8 Think twice before you waste our time.
0x00000048 Okay, already. Enough with the beep-boop-beep!
0x00000029 An artifact known as the ~mission_item~ has been found. It is of tremendous archaeological significance, and will bring great wealth to my people. Please find it for us.
0x0000006A Please find the ~mission_item~ for us. Our operatives endured super-swirlies and atomic wedgies to obtain the fragments of information we possess. All we know is ~group:star_clue~.
0x000000B6 Of course, of course. I knew it was hopeless to bring such a trivial matter to so glorious a one as yourself. Perhaps you could console me by spending money in the boutique?
0x000000BC There is no dishonor in failure, provided the attempt was sincere. It appears you simply could find the ~mission_item~ in time.
0x000000BD You failed to find ~mission_item~ in time. Karma revolves like each new day we suppose.
0x000000E4 We found an ancient text that refers to a ~mission_item~ on a distant world. Can you help us find it?
0x000000BB Perfectly understandable, Captain.~p~Sorry to trouble you with such matters.~p~
0x000000C2 Of course, of course. I knew it was hopeless to bring such a trivial matter to so glorious a one as yourself. Perhaps you could console me by spending money in the boutique?
0x000000C0 Oooh... okay.... Yes, that's alright.~p~If your heart is not in it, we wouldn't want you interacting with another life form...
0x000000C1 Interesting choice ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Perhaps you have some information we do not, although that seems unlikely.
0x000000BE Understood, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We appreciate your decorum.~p~It will actually save us a bit of paperwork. The sub-contract approval process for interplanetary creature transport requires only three hundred and sixty-two separate forms signed and stamped in triplicate.~p~Of course, this is well below the guidelines established in the Standard Operating Procedure... You should see the required forms for transporting fermented spices.
0x000000E5 A wandering trader reported that a Grox warship was observed jettisoning a ~mission_item~ on another world. If we found this item, we might discover more about the Grox! Will you join in the hunt?
0x000000E6 A ~mission_item~ is believed to exist nearby. You will find this ~mission_item~ and bring it to us.
0x000000B9 The ~race~ questions your indecision. It is clear you lack a strong force guiding your direction. How unfortunate.
0x0000010F ~player_creature_name~, you have neglected to return with the ~mission_item~ in time! We will retain this failure in our memories.
0x0000009D Good Googly Moogly! You couldn't find ~mission_item~ in time!~p~We don't know if we should laugh or cry. Maybe both.~p~Ouch, that hurt.
0x000000EE We see that you have not yet returned with the ~mission_item~, despite all available information being uploaded into your Mission Log. You will now complete the assigned mission.
0x0000008E ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, have you failed to acquire the ~mission_item~ in time?~p~Did you fail your astrogation class? This result will set our research back tremendously.
0x000000A1 Perfectly understandable, Captain.~p~Sorry to trouble you with such matters.~p~
0x0000008F Thank you! Once you locate the planet you will have just ~mission_time~ sectons to retrieve the ~mission_item~.~p~We'll look forward to continuing our spiritual advancement.
0x000000F2 You are refusing a directive of the Grox? We will remember this.
0x00000094 Magnificent... is not a magnificent enough word for such as ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~!~p~Can we burden you to locate the ~mission_item~ within ~mission_time~ sectons?
0x000000F3 I need to decline this task.
0x00000093 Thank you ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We appreciate your efforts. Once at planet ~mission_target_planet~ we expect your return within ~mission_time~ .
0x000000F6 You failed to fetch ~mission_item~ on time. Go back to planet ~mission_source_planet~ in the ~mission_source_star~ system to give them the bad news.
0x000000C5 The ~race~ questions your indecision. It is clear you lack a strong force guiding your direction. How unfortunate.
0x000000AE Oooh... okay... Yes, that's alright.~p~If your heart is not in it, we wouldn't want you interacting with another life form...~p~
0x000000E9 The artifact is believed to be on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The planet itself is thought to be in the vicinity of ~group:star_clue~. If you find this world, take the artifact on board and return here.
0x000000EB Congratulations on a successful search, Captain! Enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks!
0x000000EA The artifact is understood to be on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The planet itself is believed to be in the vicinity of ~group:star_clue~. When you find planet ~mission_target_planet~, take the artifact on board, then return to planet ~mission_source_planet~ .
0x000000B5 Interesting choice ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Perhaps you have some information we do not, although that seems unlikely.
0x000000E8 We know the approximate location of a ~mission_item~. You will complete the search on our behalf.
0x00000110 Captain, you haven't found the ~mission_item~ in time! We were so looking forward to your return!
0x000000A7 Understood, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We appreciate your decorum.~p~It will actually save us a bit of paperwork. The sub-contract approval process for interplanetary creature transport requires only three hundred and sixty-two separate forms signed and stamped in triplicate.~p~Of course, this is well below the guidelines established in the Standard Operating Procedure... You should see the required forms for transporting fermented spices.
0x000000ED You haven't returned with the ~mission_item~. Has all the information disappeared from your Mission Log?
0x000000DD the star is ~mission_clue_range_min~ to ~mission_clue_range_max~ parsecs from ~mission_clue_landmark1~
0x000000DC the star is approximately ~mission_clue_distance~ parsecs from ~mission_clue_landmark1~
0x000000A9 Too bad. We would have enjoyed watching you wander randomly around the stars.
0x000000EC ~player_creature_name~. You have successfully subordinated the needs of your species to those of the Grox. This is a survival tactic. You are granted ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000055 You have brought information that may aid the forces of life! Such generosity of spirit should be matched by your ~mission_rewards~ Spucks.
0x00000015 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. A treasured ~mission_item~ was intended as a gift for the leader of another species, to facilitate the exchange of scientific ideas and discoveries, but it was stolen in a pirate raid. Could you help us get it back?
0x0000006D Greetings ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~.~p~The Galactic Council will not be pleased. You've failed to find the ~mission_item~ in time.~p~Goodbye.
0x0000000E The Collected Works of Spode were inscribed on a ~mission_item~, but then stolen by pirates! We feel we know where the pirates hid this item. Would you help Spode's people?
0x0000005B That was excellent work. Please take your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x00000012 An ancient scroll refers to a ~mission_item~ on a distant world. This item could tell us a great deal about a vanished civilization, if we could only locate it. Will you aid us in the hunt?
0x0000001A ~mission_item~ has come back into style. We passed by a planet recently and saw one just sitting there. Could you fetch it for us?
0x00000008 There is a single mountain, but many paths. Ancient seers assure us that contemplating a ~mission_item~, found on a nearby planet, constitutes one of these paths.~p~Would that your path may lead you to this unknown location and retrieve this treasured ~mission_item~ for us.
0x0000002E Our receiver nets collected data from an alien ship breaking up somewhere nearby. We'd like you to search for valuable artifacts!
0x00000007 Guru Fldgrb has been in mental contact with a ~mission_item~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~, and assures us that if we had one of these on hand we could advance from the Forty-Third Circle of Spiritual Development to the Forty-Fourth. Would you be willing to bring us a ~mission_item~?
0x00000016 Word has come to us of a rare ~mission_item~ in the area! If we auctioned this item, we could realize spectacular profits.~p~Perhaps your glorious self would consent to aid us in this matter, in exchange for a generous commission?
0x00000042 Okay, I'm off.
0x0000000B We have found records that a vanished civilization was once engaged on something called the 'Genesis Project,' by which barren worlds could be transformed into perfect, stable ecosystems abundant with life! Records of this project were stored in a ~mission_item~. Can you help us bring light and life to the barren places of the world?
0x00000074 Say, weren't you supposed to bring ~mission_item~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~? If your memories are as bad as ours, you should check your Mission Log.
0x00000013 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. A Grox warship was observed to jettison a ~mission_item~ in a nearby star system. This item may contain valuable information concerning this mysterious race. Would you help us locate this item?
0x00000073 We await our ~mission_item~. We hate to jog the memory of someone as splendid as yourself, but we have the auctioneer here and everything! Check your Mission Log for the particulars.
0x0000000D Worshipers of the false God That Will Come are believed to venerate a ~mission_item~ hidden on a remote world. We believe we've discovered the location of the hiding place. Would you be search the planets nearby and fetch this for us?
0x0000007E I need to decline this task.
0x00000019 Our treasured ~mission_item~ was hidden away for safe keeping... but we simply can't remember where we've put it.~p~Now, the great Festival of Life is approaching and we simple must have the ~mission_item~ on display! It's tradition!!~p~
0x00000018 One of our cousins was pursued by pirates, and jettisoned his cargo on a planet nearby.~p~Could your puissance be troubled to venture there and bring us the ~mission_item~? Of course we will offer a reward.
0x00000036 Our treasured ~mission_item~ was hidden away for safe keeping... but we simply can't remember where we've put it.~p~Now, the great Festival of Chance is approaching and we simple must have the ~mission_item~ on display! It's tradition!!~p~
0x00000054 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You found planet ~mission_target_planet~! Excellent! Soon we'll be so close to the Light, you're going to need shades!
0x00000072 Were you unable to find planet ~mission_target_planet~ and the ~mission_item~? Or did you find them and then forget to consult your Mission Log concerning what to do with them?
0x00000075 You have not returned with the ~mission_item~. Was the information in your Mission Log defective? Or was there another problem?
0x00000070 We await the ~mission_item~. All that we know of planet ~mission_target_planet~ should be in your Mission Log.
0x00000041 Information is the key to victory. While the chance of finding out anything new is remote, we should nevertheless always endeavor to increase our knowledge of the tactical situation.~p~The item is on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Unfortunately this world's location is uncertain, but it's believed to be in the vicinity of ~group:star_clue~. When you locate planet ~mission_target_planet~, take the ~mission_item~ aboard, then return to planet ~mission_source_planet~ .
0x00000057 Good day, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. The Grand Council thanks you for your efforts. We are pleased to offer you these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and the Certificate of Commendation, Third Class.
0x00000009 According to our legends, a mystery world nearby is a metaphysical twin to our world here at ~mission_source_planet~, except that we lack the mystical ~mission_item~. Could you find one for us?
0x0000001D An ancient source suggests that a vanished race engraved their knowledge of the Grox on a ~mission_item~ concealed on a remote world. Do you think you could locate it for us?
0x00000014 ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. According to a recently-translated artifact, a vanished race left a ~mission_item~ behind, containing information about this species' notions of the meaning of existence, and the destination for their entire race. Could you help us find this item?
0x00000011 ~mission_item~ is a remnant of an earlier civilization that we believe was destroyed by the Grox. This item was under study by the Institute, but was stolen during a pirate attack. We believe it has been abandoned on a remote world... Would you be interested in fetching it for us?
