Unlock cells by placing supporting plants or animals.~p~Don't forget to collect some samples of flora and fauna to round out the Food Web of planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000004 I must decline, but I can't tell you why.
0x00000034 I prefer to be unbalanced.
0x0000007C I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.

0x00000055 I don't work for 'The Man'! No deal!
0x00000093 Heading: ~mission_source_star~ system.
0x0000008C Also...
0x0000008B Before I go, I have other questions.
0x00000094 Gather samples of plants and animals and take them to the ~mission_target_star~ star system. Balance the ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~ by adding the samples in the proper order.
0x000000D3 Very sorry to have bothered you. So long.

0x00000092 Gather samples of plants and animals and take them to the ~mission_target_star~ star system. Balance the ecosystem by adding the samples in the proper order.
0x00000059 No. The whole thing feels... unsporting.
0x0000008A I'd like to ask you something else...
0x00000095 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been balanced. Report back to planet ~mission_source_planet~ in system ~mission_source_star~.
0x00000088 ...
0x000000B6 Anytime. See you later.
0x00000032 Seems pretty straightforward. I'm off!
0x00000089 I beg your understanding.

0x0000008F Perhaps another time. So long.
0x000000B7 You are most generous.
0x00000091 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x000000D4 Until we speak again. So long.
0x00000057 I'm not going to do this, for several reasons.
0x00000090 I can see you are busy. We'll speak later.
0x00000087 I beg your understanding.

0x00000097 In Progress
0x000000B9 Before I go, I have other questions...
0x00000098 Completed
0x00000031 Makes sense. Guess I'll be on my way.
0x00000000 A large group of wealthy colonialists intend to settle on the planet ~mission_target_planet~. These well-heeled patrons of the Empire are hunting fans, but the ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~ lacks the proper mixture of species to support their hobby. We need you to properly seed the planet for their arrival.
0x00000086 I can see you need a moment. Farewell.
0x00000033 Okay, yeah. I know what to do.
0x00000028 Before I go, I have other questions.
0x000000B4 A pleasure to help. So long.
0x00000056 Never! Clearly, I abhor violence.
0x00000052 Will do! Take it easy!
0x000000D1 This task no longer fits into my schedule.
0x00000020 Remind me how I balance again...
0x000000AD Can you remind me of my mission?
0x00000050 Understood. Bye
0x000000BC I apologize, but must decline to continue this project.
0x000000AC I forgot what I doing. What's my mission?
0x000000AB I spaced on my mission. What is it again?
0x00000001 I prefer to be unbalanced.
0x000000C0 Also...
0x00000054 I see. I'll be back soon.
0x00000036 I'm not going to do this, for several reasons.
0x00000069 I understand. I'll be back soon.
0x000000AE Ah, of course! The mission log. I will look there!

0x00000021 Now I remember! I love to balance!
0x00000005 I regret that I must say no.
0x000000CF I'd rather do something else.

0x00000065 Understood. Bye
0x00000067 Will do! Take it easy!
0x00000051 Got it. See ya.
0x000000B1 Balance the ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x00000042 I appreciate the offer, but have to decline.
0x0000001F Balancing is one of the things I do best.

0x000000A3 Despite the data downloaded into your Mission Log, you have not completed your assignment on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you obey?
0x00000062 In multipart harmony our species sings your praises! Please travel to the ~mission_target_star~ system and restore balance to planet ~mission_target_planet~.
0x0000009B An experiment in selectively destroying organic life has succeeded on planet ~mission_target_planet~. You will restore the ecosystem so that we may perform more experiments.
0x00000074 We wonder who is more intelligent, ~player_creature_name~ or ~mission_item~ animal.
0x00000064 Thank you. Travel to planet ~mission_target_planet~, in star system ~mission_target_star~, and restore the ecosystem.
0x000000A1 You have completed your mission satisfactorily. These ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks are useless to us, but they may be of service to you.
0x000000A6 Planet ~mission_target_planet~ in star system ~mission_target_star~. Balance the Food Web, and hurry!
0x0000009A The biome of planet ~mission_target_planet~ that provides food for some of our organic servants is under stress. You will relieve the situation.
0x0000006F Of course, of course. I knew it was hopeless to bring such a trivial matter to so glorious a one as yourself. Perhaps you could console me by spending money in the boutique?
0x00000084 We wonder who is more intelligent, ~player_creature_name~ or ~mission_item~ animal.
0x000000A2 You've saved planet ~mission_target_planet~ from eco-collapse! We're so totally impressed! Have ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks and our complete gratitude!
0x0000005B I commend your attitude on behalf of the Grand Council. Many future settlers will be deeply grateful.
0x00000081 Quit is not something ~race~ understand. ~player_creature_name~ is not ~race~.
0x0000006D Oooh... okay... Yes, that's alright. ~p~If your heart is not in it, we wouldn't want you interacting with another life form... ~p~
0x0000006C You must follow your own path.~p~Be well my friend.
0x0000009D The valuable ecology of planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been destroyed by a meteor strike. Captain, you are our best hope.
0x00000075 Perfectly understandable, Captain.~p~Sorry to trouble you with such matters.
0x0000009E Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has suffered a burst of gamma radiation that has destroyed several crucial species. We need you to restore the Food Web!
0x00000063 Thank you! We'll send you aid through the luminiferous ether!
0x0000006E Interesting choice ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Perhaps you have some information we do not, although that seems unlikely.
0x00000073 You dare to go back on your word to the Grox! Insolent fool!
0x0000007D Oooh... okay... Yes, that's alright. ~p~If your heart is not in it, we wouldn't want you interacting with another life form... ~p~
0x0000005E We won't forget your efforts. Save the ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~!
0x0000009C A plague has wiped out several important species at planet ~mission_target_planet~. We need you to restore the balance before the ecosystem collapses!
0x000000A4 Despite the data downloaded into your Mission Log, you haven't restored the Food Web on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you act now and avert this disaster?
0x0000007E Interesting choice ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Perhaps you have some information we do not, although that seems unlikely.
0x0000007F Of course, of course. I knew it was hopeless to bring such a trivial matter to so glorious a one as yourself. Perhaps you could console me by spending money in the boutique?
0x000000D0 I need to decline this task.
0x00000077 You must follow your own path.~p~Be well my friend.
0x0000005D You could prevent the extinction of an entire ecosystem! Thank you for your help at star system ~mission_target_star~!
0x00000060 Please journey at once to planet ~mission_target_planet~, in star system ~mission_target_star~, and restore equilibrium. A balanced food web will prove invaluable to all species, even yours.
0x0000006A Perfectly understandable, Captain.~p~Sorry to trouble you with such matters.~p~
0x0000006B Understood, ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We appreciate your decorum.~p~It will actually save us a bit of paperwork. The sub-contract approval process for interplanetary creature transport requires only three hundred and sixty-two separate forms signed and stamped in triplicate. ~p~Of course, this is well below the guidelines established in the Standard Operating Procedure... You should see the required forms for transporting fermented spices.

0x0000005C Travel at once to the ~mission_target_star~ system and save the creatures of planet ~mission_target_planet~. The life of the entire planet is at stake!
0x000000A5 Travel immediately to planet ~mission_target_planet~, in star system ~mission_target_star~. Balance the Food Web.
0x00000071 Quit is not something ~race~ understand. ~player_creature_name~ is not ~race~.
0x0000004E Despite the data in your Mission Log, you have not fulfilled your task on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you act with honor, or cowardice?
0x0000004A Despite the data in your Mission Log, you seem to have left uncompleted your task on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The Food Web is still incomplete, and the ecosystem is still in danger. Your choice is binary. Will you aid us or not?
0x00000041 You have aided us, and you will not find us ungrateful. Please take ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.
0x0000004C Our people on planet ~mission_target_planet~ are still in danger, and now we've spent all this money on party hats because we thought you'd save them and we could celebrate.~p~Will you save the Life-Web? All necessary information should be found in your Mission Log.
0x0000000D Demonic forces opposed to the Will of Spode have contrived to unbalance the ecology of planet ~mission_target_planet~. We solemnly vow to protect Spode's Creation. Will you aid us?
0x00000007 Our covenant guarantees that our citizens will remain free from want. Yet a plague has removed certain species from the Life Web of our farming planet ~mission_target_planet~ and imperiled production of food. Will you undertake a mission to save the Life Web and keep this food source vital?
0x00000048 The Life Web on planet ~mission_target_planet~ is still endangered! Can you restore this delicate balance? All the important data should be in your Mission Log.
0x00000010 An unfortunate reliance on monoculture resulted in a dangerous ecological imbalance when certain species proved vulnerable to a plague. Unfortunately this has endangered a fragile bio-diversity at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you give us aid?
0x00000016 This miserable being regrets the necessity of bringing this matter to the attention of a being of your puissance. An important farming planet, ~mission_target_planet~ has endured an environmental catastrophe. Will your mightiness save the Life Web on planet ~mission_target_planet~ and restore this vital resource? Great rewards can be yours.
0x0000003A You have acted in accord with the highest ideals of civilization. On behalf of the Grand Council, I am authorized to offer you mission rewards and this Certificate of Commendation, Second Class.
0x00000040 Thank you for restoring the world of planet ~mission_target_planet~! Please take ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and we'll be sure to adjust your ship's feng shui before you leave!
0x0000000C An extinction-level event threatens planet ~mission_target_planet~! The death of certain species could tip the entire ecology toward annihilation! Can you help us with a rescue mission?
0x00000009 A biological strike by domestic terrorists has badly damaged the Food Web of planet ~mission_target_planet~. The Grand Council is attempting to restore security, but in the meantime our concern is to restore the planet to vitality. Can you help us?
0x00000012 One of our scientists got a bit space happy and created a plague! He managed to exterminate several species on planet ~mission_target_planet~, and the world is now facing environmental catastrophe. Can you help us restore the Life Web?
0x0000003B You have helped save many irreplaceable bioforms! We're happy to offer you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and the title, Friend of the Cosmos!

0x00000013 A spoilsport meteor went and dropped right on our planet! Now the whole ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~ has gone kerflooey. Can you help us restore this playground?
0x00000017 Alas, that catastrophe has overwhelmed planet ~mission_target_planet~! A meteor strike has eliminated crucial species, leaving the rest vulnerable to slow starvation!~p~Only a being of your greatness could possibly save our people! Naturally, we will offer considerable rewards.
0x00000018 Such an insignificant being as myself can barely bring herself to trouble such a magnificent one as you, but I am compelled by necessity. A series of plagues have eradicated key life-forms on planet ~mission_target_planet~, and now our settlement is threatened with extinction. Could you possibly be bothered to aid them, in exchange of course, for munificent rewards?
0x0000004D Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is still teetering on the edge of mass extinctions. Will you bring them new species, as spelled out in your Mission Log?
0x00000014 planet ~mission_target_planet~ was a perfect place for people who wanted to lose weight, since the ecosystem was so incomplete that it was difficult to find any food at all. But now we're totally into self-acceptance, and diets are a thing of the past! Can you help planet ~mission_target_planet~ become fashionable again?
0x0000001C Even though we routed their attack, enemy bio-strikes have nevertheless disabled the ecology on planet ~mission_target_planet~. We are now dangerously weak in the agricultural sector. Would you be willing to restore our Food Web?
0x00000011 Radiation from a gamma ray burster has resulted in the extinction of species on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you help us restore the Life Web after this catastrophe?
0x00000015 During the Autumn Festival, our people go out into the wilderness and eat nuts, berries, and wild animals. Unfortunately the people on planet ~mission_target_planet~ were having such a good time that the party went on and on, and now whole species are extinct. There's nothing left to eat! Can you fix the biome so we can plan picnics again?
0x0000003D In the past, we have discovered recompense to be useful in gaining the cooperation of another species. We therefore offer ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks to you.
0x0000001D We wrested planet ~mission_target_planet~ from a defeated enemy, but the ecosystem was subject to collateral damage. You are invited to aid us in restoring the biome.
0x0000001A The uses of Natural Wellness Tonic from planet ~mission_target_planet~ was widespread throughout our civilization, but overuse resulted in the species that provided the ingredients facing extinction! Can you restore the wellness both of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and of ourselves?
0x0000001B Despite the unprecedented healing chants that we performed, a plague eliminated a number of species on planet ~mission_target_planet~, badly affecting the Food Web! Can you help us before these small beings starve to death?
0x00000008 A shift of the magnetic poles of planet ~mission_target_planet~ has resulted in a cosmic ray bombardment that has destroyed important links in the planet's Food Web. The Grand Council is doing its best to prevent bio-disaster. Perhaps you can be of service?
0x0000004B Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is still agog with anticipation! What plants and animals will you bring them? The requirements are in your Mission Log?
0x00000046 Still haven't balanced the Food Wed on planet ~mission_target_planet~??~p~But it's so easy!~p~Gather some samples of plants and animals. Identify the gaps in the Food Web and fill them in the right order. Quickly!
0x0000000E Our campaign against plants and animals deemed unclean by Spode has been successful on planet ~mission_target_planet~! Unfortunately this has resulted in a damaged Food Web. Can you help us restore the harmony of Creation?
0x00000047 Our food sources are still in peril. The details of the mission should be spelled out in your Mission Log. Will you save the Life-Web of planet ~mission_target_planet~ or not?
0x0000001E Radiation from a gamma-ray burster has disabled the ecosystem on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you help us restore it?
0x0000003C The believers of planet ~mission_target_planet~ sing Spode's praises! You have shown yourself to be a Friend of Spode. Take ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks in Spode's name, along with a copy of the Word of Spode.

0x0000003E The word of the day is 'lush', my friends! You've turned planet ~mission_target_planet~ into a biome brimming with flora and fauna! Enjoy ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks and be sure we'll call on you again!
0x0000000F Our theologians are having difficulty with the Food Web on planet ~mission_target_planet~. This planet is a vital food source to our people? Can you give us aid?
0x00000039 Our experimental research station at planet ~mission_target_planet~ requires maintenance. You shall provide this.
0x00000019 Despite our sacrificing flowers to the Volcano Goddess, a massive eruption blocked the sun's rays from planet ~mission_target_planet~, and resulted in the extinction of several species. Now the whole planet is dying! Can you help us restore the balance of nature?
0x00000083 You dare to go back on your word to the Grox! Insolent fool!
0x0000000A One of our gardening planets is in jeopardy! The extinction of crucial species has unbalanced the ecology of ~mission_target_planet~. Our great compact with the natural world is in danger! Will you help us save planet ~mission_target_planet~ and its inhabitants?
0x00000072 The ~race~ questions your indecision. It is clear you lack a strong force guiding your direction. How unfortunate.
